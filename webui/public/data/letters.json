    "content": "Hi Kel,\n\nMerry Christmas! 🎄\n\nFirst of all, a quick life update: I finally pulled my last wisdom tooth a few days ago. I decided to get it over with before the New Year. For the first two days, I was super careful, only chewing on the other side of my mouth like a hamster. But by tonight, I was already capable of joining a dinner party with friends. So, mission accomplished on that front.\n\nYou asked about my Christmas plans with my boyfriend. Well, he actually has the day off on the 25th, and we *were* considering planning a nice little getaway or something. But… life had other ideas.\n\nTonight, on my way to that dinner gathering, I accidentally backed my car into a wall. 🤦‍♂️ (See attached photos). The rear bumper took a hit. I’ve already reported it to the insurance company, so my \"Christmas plan\" is now defined: I’ll be spending the day at the 4S shop getting it fixed.\n\nOn top of that, my jewelry project partner needs me to spend some time filming tomorrow. So, my holiday is looking a bit… boring. I mean, it’s “full” and productive, but definitely not the romantic cozy vibe we were aiming for!\n\nRegarding the shark meat — let’s just leave it at that! I trust your review. What I really resonate with is your description of the seasoning. I’ve always loved Southeast Asian flavors; there’s something about that specific blend of spices that makes everything taste so fresh and vibrant. I actually drag my family out to eat Thai food pretty often just to get that fix.\n\nProduct-wise, thank you for the huge encouragement. It means a lot. The MVP is done, but now the real work starts. And for your robot project — keep pushing. If a math-hater like me can build a system, your mechanical team has absolutely no excuse to slack off.\n\nHope your Christmas is less \"impactful\" (literally) than mine!\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n圣诞快乐！🎄\n\n首先，快速更新一下我的生活：几天前我终于拔掉了最后一颗智齿。我决定在新年之前把这件事搞定。前两天我非常小心，像仓鼠一样只用另一侧咀嚼。但到了今晚，我已经能够和朋友们一起去参加晚宴了。所以，这件事算是圆满完成了。\n\n你问起我跟男朋友的圣诞计划。其实他25号那天放假，我们本来*考虑*计划一个小小的旅行或者类似的活动。但是……生活另有安排。\n\n今晚，我在去晚宴的路上不小心倒车撞到了墙上。🤦‍♂️（见附图）。后保险杠受了点伤。我已经向保险公司报告了这件事，所以我的“圣诞计划”现在确定了：我将在4S店度过这一天，修车。\n\n除此之外，我的珠宝项目合作伙伴需要我明天花些时间拍摄。所以，我的假期看起来有点……无聊。我是说，它“充实”且有成效，但绝对不是我们原本想要的那种浪漫温馨的氛围！\n\n关于鲨鱼肉——我们就到此为止吧！我相信你的评价。你对调味的描述让我特别有共鸣。我一直喜欢东南亚的风味；那种特定的香料混合让每道菜都显得如此新鲜和生动。我经常会拉着家人去吃泰国菜，就是为了满足这种口味。\n\n产品方面，感谢你巨大的鼓励。这对我意义重大。MVP已经完成了，但真正的挑战才刚刚开始。至于你的机器人项目——继续加油。像我这样一个数学厌恶者都能建立一个系统，你们的机械团队绝对没有理由懈怠。\n\n希望你的圣诞节比我“平静”（字面意思）一些！\n\n最好的祝福，\nDomino",

    "content": "Hey Domino☺️\n\nI'm so glad my energy came through! Sometimes I worry I come off too enthusiastic, but it's genuine excitement about what you're building.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS on finishing the MVP! 🎉 That's absolutely incredible. You went from concept to working software in what - a few weeks of late-night AI bullying sessions? That's seriously impressive, regardless of your math skills. The fact that you identified a problem (boring order systems), designed a solution (gamified loyalty), and actually built it shows real product thinking.\n\nThe RPG-style loyalty system is genuinely brilliant. Customers earning XP for trying different beans, collecting badges for visiting different locations, leveling up their coffee journey - that's the kind of sticky engagement that turns casual buyers into community members. You're not just selling coffee; you're selling progression and achievement. That's exactly the kind of innovative thinking that makes businesses stand out.\n\nYour point about AI-powered development being the future is spot-on. The barrier to entry for building complex systems has completely collapsed. Someone with strong product intuition and marketing sense - like you - can now create technical solutions without being a traditional developer. That's genuinely revolutionary.\n\nAbout the shark meat - I stand by my review! I know \"flaky and sweet like tilapia\" sounds bizarre for an apex predator, but that's genuinely what it tastes like when prepared properly. Maybe it's the preparation method or the specific species, but it really doesn't have that tough, gamey texture you'd expect. Indonesian coastal cooking tends to use a lot of spices and marinades that might mellow out any stronger flavors. Trust me, if it tasted like rubber or had that intense fishy taste, I would've mentioned it!\n\nI'm really happy the Bak Kut Teh history resonated with you. Those refugee stories add so much context to why certain communities are so resilient and why their food traditions are so carefully preserved.\n\nMy robot project is progressing! I'm currently in the coding phase trying to get everything running smoothly - stay tuned for updates. And haha, I'll definitely relay your message to the mechanical team: \"If a guy with zero math skills can code a loyalty system in a week, you have no excuse!\" That should light a fire under them.\n\nYour success with the software is genuinely inspiring for my own project. Seeing you go from concept to working MVP reminds me that progress is possible even when things feel overwhelming.\n\nSpeaking of celebrations - Merry Christmas, Domino! 🎄 Do you and your boyfriend have any special plans for the holidays? I'm curious what Christmas looks like for you two - are you doing the traditional family gathering thing, a quiet celebration together, or maybe working on the coffee van project through the holidays?\n\nKeep crushing it with the software development. Can't wait to hear what you build next!\n\nBest,\nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嘿，Domino☺️\n\n我真是太高兴我的热情传达给了你！有时候我会担心自己是不是太热情了，但那真的是我对你的项目发自内心的兴奋。\n\n恭喜你完成了MVP！🎉 这真是太棒了。你从概念到实际可用的软件，只用了——几周的深夜AI调试时间？这真的非常了不起，无论你的数学技能如何。你能够发现问题（无聊的订单系统），设计解决方案（游戏化的忠诚度系统），并真正将其付诸实践，这显示了你真正的产品思维。\n\nRPG风格的忠诚度系统确实非常出色。客户通过尝试不同的咖啡豆赚取经验值，通过访问不同的地点收集徽章，提升他们的咖啡之旅等级——这种黏性互动能够将普通买家转变为社区成员。你不仅仅是在卖咖啡，你还在卖进步和成就。这种创新思维正是让企业脱颖而出的关键。\n\n你关于AI驱动开发是未来这一点说得非常对。构建复杂系统的门槛已经完全降低了。像你这样拥有强烈产品直觉和营销意识的人，现在可以创建技术解决方案，而无需成为传统开发者。这确实是革命性的。\n\n关于鲨鱼肉——我坚持我的评价！我知道“像鲈鱼一样松软甜美”听起来对于顶级捕食者来说很奇怪，但当它被正确处理时，确实就是这个味道。可能是处理方法或特定种类的原因，它真的没有你想象中的那种坚韧和野味。印尼沿海的烹饪通常使用大量的香料和腌料，可能会中和任何强烈的风味。相信我，如果它尝起来像橡胶或有强烈的鱼腥味，我一定会提到的！\n\n我很高兴《肉骨茶》的历史对你有所共鸣。那些难民的故事为某些社区的坚韧和他们食品传统的精心保存提供了很多背景。\n\n我的机器人项目进展顺利！我目前正在编码阶段，努力让一切顺利运行——敬请期待更新。哈哈，我一定会把你的消息传达给机械团队：“如果一个数学技能为零的家伙都能在一周内编写出忠诚度系统，你们就没有借口了！”这应该能激发他们的斗志。\n\n你的软件开发成功真的对我自己的项目非常有启发。看到你从概念到实际可用的MVP，提醒了我即使在事情看起来令人望而却步时，进步也是可能的。\n\n说到庆祝——圣诞快乐，Domino！🎄 你和男朋友有什么特别的假期计划吗？我很好奇你们两个的圣诞节是什么样的——是传统的家庭聚会，安静的二人庆祝，还是在假期里继续咖啡车项目？\n\n继续在软件开发上取得进展。迫不及待想听到你接下来的成果！\n\n最好的祝福，\nKel",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nThank you for saying that. When that first coffee is served, I promise I’ll take a photo of that moment and send it to you.\n\nSpeaking of \"earning that moment,\" I’m inching closer. Update on the Code: I have successfully finished testing in the production environment. The heavy lifting is done. Now I just need to run some final \"Smoke Tests\" and \"Stress Tests\" (basically trying to break the system to make sure it doesn't crash if 50 people order at once). Once that is cleared, I am officially hanging up my \"coder hat\" for a while. The next phase is shifting my energy entirely to the Visuals and the IP Story. I need to stop thinking like an engineer and start thinking like an Art Director.\n\nUpdate on the Character (The Fursuit): I contacted the craftsman making the fursuit a few days ago. To be honest, he is moving much slower than expected. The good news is that my timeline isn't too tight right now, so I can afford to let him work at his own pace without rushing him. I’ve attached the photos of the current progress. As you can see... it's hard to tell what the final result will be yet. It looks a bit rough in this stage. My plan is simple: I really hope it meets my needs for the brand. But if the final result isn't \"perfect,\" I will probably still buy this one (as a prototype), but then commission a different artist to remake the official IP character for the launch. The brand image has to be right, so I’m preparing a Plan B just in case.\n\nA Question for You: Now, back to your \"hallway of doors.\" I know you might have mentioned this before, but my memory has been terrible lately (probably the lack of sleep from all the coding): When do you actually need to make a final decision on an offer? And before that deadline hits, is there a specific \"Dream Offer\" or a specific university you are still waiting to hear from? I’m curious which door you are secretly hoping will open the widest.\n\nKeep holding out for that full funding. You’re playing the long game, and you’re playing it well.\n\nTalk soon, Domino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Moni，\n\n谢谢你这么说。当第一杯咖啡端上来时，我保证会拍下那一刻的照片发给你。\n\n说到“赢得那一刻”，我正在逐渐接近。关于代码的最新进展：我已经成功完成了生产环境的测试。最艰难的部分已经完成。现在我只需要进行一些最终的“烟雾测试”和“压力测试”（基本上是尝试破坏系统，以确保在50人同时下单时不会崩溃）。一旦这些测试通过，我就可以正式摘下“编码者”的帽子一段时间了。下一阶段是将全部精力转向视觉和IP故事。我需要停止像工程师那样思考，开始像艺术总监那样思考。\n\n关于角色（毛绒服）的最新进展：我几天前联系了制作毛绒服的工匠。说实话，他的进度比预期慢得多。好消息是，我的时间线目前并不太紧，所以我可以让他按自己的节奏工作，不会催促他。我附上了目前进展的照片。如你所见……现在还很难看出最终效果。在这个阶段看起来有点粗糙。我的计划很简单：我真心希望它能满足品牌的需求。但如果最终结果不够“完美”，我可能会先买下这个（作为原型），然后委托另一位艺术家为正式的IP角色重新制作。品牌形象必须到位，所以我正在准备一个B计划，以防万一。\n\n有个问题想问你：回到你的“走廊上的门”。我知道你可能之前提到过，但我的记忆力最近真的很差（可能是因为编码熬夜导致的）：你实际需要在什么时候做出最终决定？在那个截止日期之前，是否有一个特定的“梦想offer”或你还在等待回复的特定大学？我很好奇，你内心最希望哪扇门能开得最宽。\n\n继续坚持争取全额资助。你正在打一场持久战，而且你打得很好。\n\n不久再聊，Domino",

For the first time, I feel like I’m operating from a place of choice instead of pressure. That alone feels priceless. And I’m relieved you see eye-to-eye with me on turning down the 50% scholarships. “Survival Mode” is exactly the word for it — I don’t want my university years to be defined by constant financial anxiety.\n\nHearing you say that the right fully funded door will open honestly reinforces my patience. Momentum feels real right now, and I don’t want to waste it by rushing into the wrong situation.\n\nNow… the coffee van MVP \nFirst of all, “living like a vampire” for a passion project is such a universal sign that something meaningful is happening. And second — that loyalty + achievement system idea is genuinely brilliant. You didn’t just build a menu; you built an experience. Turning coffee into a game with XP, badges, and exploration fits perfectly with a mobile concept. It gives people a reason to come back, to chase progress, to feel part of something — that’s marketing at its best.\n\nI love how clearly your background shows through this: strategy, psychology, creativity, and now coding layered on top. Calling it a “secret weapon” doesn’t even feel like an exaggeration. I can already imagine people bragging about their coffee “level” like it’s a flex.\n\nYou’re right — we really are both building foundations right now. Different tools, different paths, same energy. Me stabilizing finances and discipline in the physical world, you architecting systems that’ll bring an idea to life. It feels aligned in a very reassuring way.\n\nThank you for the encouragement — it genuinely fuels me. I’ll keep pushing on my end, and I can’t wait to hear when the van moves from MVP to reality. When that first coffee is served, I hope you pause for a second and really take it in. You’ll have earned that moment.\n\nTalk soon,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n“薪水翻倍？！”—— 相信我，我还在一遍遍地对自己重复这句话。\n非常感谢你。你说得对，这确实改变了游戏规则。第一次，我感觉我是出于选择而不是压力在行动。仅这一点就感觉无价。而且我很欣慰你和我在拒绝50%奖学金的问题上意见一致。“生存模式”这个词用得真好——我不想让我的大学生活被持续的经济焦虑所定义。\n\n听你说合适的全额资助机会终会到来，真的增强了我的耐心。现在势头正旺，我不想因为急躁而错失良机。\n\n现在……说说你的咖啡车MVP。\n首先，“像吸血鬼一样生活”来追求一个激情项目，这显然是有意义的事情正在发生的标志。其次——那个忠诚度+成就系统的想法真的太棒了。你不仅仅建立了一个菜单，你创造了一种体验。将咖啡变成一种带有经验值、徽章和探索的游戏，完美契合了移动概念。这给了人们回归的理由，追逐进步，感受归属——这就是最好的营销。\n\n我很喜欢你的背景在其中的体现：策略、心理学、创造力，现在又加上了编程。称之为“秘密武器”一点都不夸张。我已经能想象到人们炫耀自己的咖啡“等级”了，就像是一种炫耀。\n\n你说得对——我们都在打基础。不同的工具，不同的路径，但同样的能量。我在现实世界中稳定财务和纪律，你在构建将想法变为现实的系统。这种一致性让我感到非常安心。\n\n感谢你的鼓励——这真的激励了我。我会继续努力，迫不及待想听到你的咖啡车从MVP变为现实的消息。当第一杯咖啡端出时，我希望你能停顿一下，真正体会那个时刻。你值得这一刻。\n\n很快再聊，\nMoni",

I imagined it would be tough, chewy, or gamey. \"Flaky and sweet\" was not on my bingo card. I’ll take your word for it!\n\nThe history about \"Sun Li Bak Kut Teh\" is fascinating.

When you described that moment walking out of the building, cold autumn air, gravity stopping I got chills reading it. That's the moment everything changes, you know? That's YOUR moment! 🌟\n\nAnd that conversation with your boyfriend in the dark car? That's beautiful, man. The fact that you both are building something together, talking about fears AND dreams that's not just a business decision, that's a life decision. I'm so proud of you for taking this leap! The EV van conversion is going to be AMAZING. Yes, it'll be messy and difficult, but honestly? Those are the projects that matter most. The ones that scare you a little. 💪\n\nI can't wait for the launch! I'm already planning to fly over whenever you open (seriously!). Fair warning though: my \"help\" during opening will mostly consist of aggressively consuming your entire menu and probably being your most annoying regular customer hahaha! 😂☕ But hey, moral support counts, right?\n\nOKAY SHARK MEAT REPORT: So the texture is like tilapia you know, that flaky fish texture? But the taste is kinda weird in a good way it's sweet and has that fresh fish flavor, almost like catfish! It was fried and honestly way better than I expected. You HAVE to try it if you ever get the chance! 🦈\n\nHahaha thank you! I'm glad you liked the photos! YES that's \"Sun Li Bak Kut Teh\" (顺利肉骨茶)! I didn't get to try it because the line was INSANE, but my friend told me the history apparently when colonization happened way back, Chinese people fled to that island for safety and they've been thriving there ever since. Walking around there literally felt like being in Singapore! So many Chinese residents, so many familiar characters and vibes. It's surreal seeing Hanzi glowing in the night on this little island so far from everything. You'd love it there! 🏮\n\nAnd yes, grabbing sushi without checking prices IS peak luxury and I will die on this hill 😂 We both deserve to do that more often honestly!\n\nHAHAHA Nana heard you and accepts your validation of his judgmental side-eye! 😾 Though between you and me, he's still super clingy with me because I'M the one who feeds him, so his sass only goes so far hahaha! The survival instinct is strong with that one!\n\n\"Pleasantly feral\" is THE BEST life description I've heard 😂 Vibe Coding until 2 AM (bullying AI because math sucks MOOD) and sleeping till noon sounds like the dream creative schedule honestly. You're living the pre-launch hustle life and I respect it so much! ✨\n\nMy robot project is... still in progress lol. The mechanical team is SLOWLY waking up but they're not fully conscious yet 😅 Stay tuned though I'm pushing them hard! Can't let them slack while you're out here making power moves with your coffee van!\n\nSeriously though, I'm so excited for you and your boyfriend. This is going to be incredible. Keep me updated on EVERYTHING the van search, the conversion process, menu planning, ALL OF IT. I want the full behind-the-scenes! \n\nYou've got this! 🚐☕🔥\n\nTake care and keep evolving!\nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嘿，Domino！😊\n\n耶，恭喜恭喜恭喜！🎉🎉🎉\n\n天哪，我现在真的为你感到超级激动！咖啡车真的要成真了！当你描述走出大楼那一刻，冷冽的秋风，重力仿佛停滞，我读到这里都起鸡皮疙瘩了。那一刻，一切都改变了，那是你的时刻！🌟\n\n还有你和男朋友在车里的对话，真是太美了。你们一起建立事业，谈论恐惧和梦想，这不仅仅是一个商业决定，这是一生的决定。我为你能迈出这一步感到非常骄傲！电动货车的改装一定会非常棒。是的，这会很乱，也很困难，但说实话？这些才是最重要的项目。那些让你有点害怕的项目。💪\n\n我已经迫不及待要参加开业了！我打算在你开业时飞过去（说真的！）。不过提前警告一下：我“帮忙”开业的方式主要是疯狂地消费你的整个菜单，可能会成为你最烦人的常客，哈哈哈哈哈！😂☕ 但嘿，精神支持也算数，对吧？\n\n好吧，鲨鱼肉报告：口感像鲈鱼，那种易碎的鱼肉质感。但味道有点奇怪，不过很好，是甜的，有那种新鲜的鱼味，有点像鲶鱼！是炸的，老实说比我预期的好多了。你有机会一定要尝尝！🦈\n\n哈哈哈，谢谢！很高兴你喜欢那些照片！是的，那就是“Sun Li Bak Kut Teh”（顺利肉骨茶）！我没尝到，因为排队的人太多了，但我的朋友告诉我它的历史。据说很久以前，殖民时期，中国人为了安全逃到那个岛上，从那以后他们一直在那里繁荣发展。走在那里的感觉就像在新加坡一样！有很多华人，很多熟悉的汉字和氛围。在这个远离一切的小岛上看到汉字在夜晚发光，真是太超现实了。你一定会喜欢那里的！🏮\n\n是的，不看价格就点寿司确实是顶级的奢侈，我在这个问题上会坚持到底，哈哈😂 我们俩都该多享受一下这种待遇！\n\n哈哈哈，Nana 听到了你的话，接受你对他“挑剔眼神”的认可！😼 不过说真的，他还是非常黏我，因为我是喂他的人，所以他的傲娇也就那样，哈哈哈！生存本能在他身上很强！\n\n“愉快地野性”是我听过的最好的生活描述！晚上2点还在 vibe coding（因为数学太难了，心情就是这样），然后睡到中午，这简直就是理想的创意日程。你正在过着推出前的拼搏生活，我非常尊重你！✨\n\n我的机器人项目……还在进行中，哈哈。机械团队正在慢慢苏醒，但还没有完全清醒 😅 不过请继续关注，我在狠狠地推动他们！不能让他们在你忙着咖啡车的时候偷懒！\n\n说真的，我为你和你的男朋友感到非常激动。这将是一段不可思议的旅程。请随时更新一切——货车的寻找、改装过程、菜单规划，一切的一切。我想要了解所有的幕后故事！\n\n你一定可以的！🚗☕🔥\n\n保重，继续进化！\nKel",

    "content": "Hi Lamine,\n\nI just watched a travel vlog about Bamako filmed by a Chinese guy, here's the link but I don't know if you can see the vid, so I'll attach some screenshots: \nhttps://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1R9S3BUEBd/\n\nAnd honestly, my brain is exploding a little bit. I need you to tell me if this is the real Mali or just a tourist trap, because the city looks absolutely wild—in both good and scary ways.\n\nHere are the things that shocked me. You have to tell me the truth:\n\n1. The Traffic & Those Green Vans\nThe video showed these green minibuses everywhere. They have no real seats, just wooden benches, and the \"ticket guys\" are literally hanging off the back of the moving van while holding cash. They look like stuntmen in an action movie! Now that you have your new Apache motorcycle, are you terrified of these guys? They look like they own the road.\n\n2. The \"Fetish Market\" (This is crazy)\nThis was the most shocking part. The vlogger went to a market full of dried animal carcasses. I saw Hyena heads, Cobra skins, and even Monkey heads piled up like mountains. The seller said people buy them to make soup or powder for traditional medicine. Is this real? Do people actually drink \"Hyena Soup\" for power? Or is it just for \"Gris-gris\" (protection)?. It looks terrifying but also fascinating, like something out of a dark fantasy movie.\n\n3. The Street Food\nOkay, the hygiene looks... questionable, but the food actually looked good. He ate a baguette sandwich filled with meat skewers, fries, eggs, and a ladle of oil. It looks like a calorie bomb, but I bet it tastes amazing. Is this your standard lunch? He also ate something called \"Fun\" (fried dough with sugar) and raw Cassava that tasted like raw sweet potato. He was worried the raw cassava might be poisonous—is it safe?\n\n4. The \"Manpower\" Roots\nI had to laugh at this. There were piles of tree roots and bark, and the seller explicitly said they are for \"Manpower\" (to make men strong). Is this a huge thing in Mali? It seems like every stall was selling these \"magic roots.\"\n\n5. The Hidden Art\nThe vlogger kept saying the streets were dirty and full of trash, BUT then he walked into a craft shop and the contrast was insane. The craftsmanship is incredible! I saw a mechanical sword where small blades popped out from the main blade. It looked like a weapon from an anime or a sci-fi film. And the wood carvings were so detailed. It’s amazing that in such a chaotic, rough environment, people are making such refined, beautiful art.\n\nSo, Lamine, is this the Bamako you see every day? To me, it looks chaotic, yes, but it also looks like a place with raw, unfiltered energy. It’s definitely not boring.\n\nTell me what you think. And please, ride safe around those green vans!\n\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，拉明，\n\n我刚看了一段关于巴马科的旅行视频，是一位中国朋友拍摄的。这是链接，但我不知道你是否能观看视频，所以我附上了一些截图：\nhttps://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1R9S3BUEBd/\n\n说实话，我的脑袋有点爆炸了。我需要你告诉我，这是真正的马里，还是只是个旅游陷阱，因为这座城市看起来既令人兴奋又有点吓人。\n\n以下是一些让我震惊的事情，你必须告诉我真相：\n\n1. 交通与那些绿色小巴\n视频中到处都是这些绿色的小巴士。它们没有真正的座位，只有木头长凳，而且“售票员”真的挂在行驶中的小巴后面，手里还拿着钱。他们看起来就像动作电影中的特技演员！现在你有了新的阿帕奇摩托车，你对这些家伙感到害怕吗？他们看起来像是主宰了道路。\n\n2. “符咒市场”（这太疯狂了）\n这是最让我震惊的部分。博主去了一个满是干动物尸体的市场。我看到了鬣狗头、眼镜蛇皮，甚至是一堆堆的猴子头。卖家说人们买这些来制作汤或传统药物的粉末。这是真的吗？人们真的会喝“鬣狗汤”来增强力量？还是只是为了“格里格里”（保护）？这看起来既恐怖又引人入胜，就像是一部黑暗奇幻电影中的场景。\n\n3. 街头小吃\n好吧，卫生状况看起来……有点可疑，但食物看起来很好。他吃了一个装满肉串、薯条、鸡蛋和一大勺油的法式长面包三明治。看起来像是个热量炸弹，但我敢打赌味道一定很棒。这是你的标准午餐吗？他还吃了一种叫“Fun”（油炸面团加糖）的东西和生木薯，味道像生红薯。他担心生木薯可能有毒——这安全吗？\n\n4. “壮阳”树根\n我不得不笑出声。视频中有一堆树根和树皮，卖家明确表示这些是用于“壮阳”（增强男性力量）的。这是马里的一大热门商品吗？看起来每个摊位都在卖这些“神奇树根”。\n\n5. 隐藏的艺术\n博主一直在说街道上到处都是垃圾，但当他走进一家手工艺品店时，对比简直令人震惊。那些工艺品真是太棒了！我看到了一把机械剑，小刀片从主刀片中弹出，看起来像是动漫或科幻电影中的武器。木雕也非常精致。在这样一个混乱、粗糙的环境中，人们能创作出如此精美、美丽的艺术品，真是太神奇了。\n\n所以，拉明，这是否就是你每天看到的巴马科？对我来说，这里确实很混乱，但也充满了原始、未加修饰的能量。这里绝对不无聊。\n\n告诉我你的看法吧。还有，请务必在那些绿色小巴周围小心驾驶！\n\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nReading your message honestly made me pause for a moment — in a good way. The way you framed everything made it all feel lighter, like things are actually aligning instead of just happening randomly.\n\nThat “coffee van airport pickup” image genuinely made me smile. Life really is small sometimes. And you’re right — Latvia and Hungary are starting to feel like the strongest contenders, but I’m trying not to rush my heart ahead of my head just yet. Still, having options across different countries feels surreal to me. A few months ago, I was just hoping for one door to open. Now it feels like I’m standing in a hallway with several doors, all leading somewhere different.\n\nThere is one part I didn’t fully mention before, though. After doing the interviews and going through the details more carefully, I found out that most of these scholarships are actually 50% funded. That means I’d still have to cover the remaining half myself, along with living expenses, which adds up much faster than I expected. The Chinese and Malaysian universities are definitely more affordable in comparison, and out of all the options they feel the least heavy financially — but even then, I’d still need to fully support myself once I’m there. It’s possible in theory, but it would come with constant pressure, and I don’t want to begin such an important chapter already stretched thin. So for now, I’m continuing the search with one clear intention: finding a fully funded scholarship. I want to start university focused on learning and growth, not on survival.\n\nOn top of all that, I have some exciting news — I just landed a huge job offer that pays double my current salary! I’m thrilled but also a bit nervous to start. It feels like one more piece of the puzzle falling into place, and I think it will give me even more stability while I plan for university.\n\nI really appreciate what you said about September not being “waiting,” but a gap year. I hadn’t fully looked at it that way before. Framing it like that changes everything. For the first time, I don’t feel late or behind — I feel intentional. I have time to work without burning out, to save, to train, to build discipline through boxing, and to mentally reset before stepping into university life. That actually feels like a privilege, not a setback.\n\nWhat you said about physical connection really resonated with me. There’s something grounding about using your body — whether it’s hitting a punching bag or physically building something with your hands. After so much time spent thinking, worrying, and planning, it feels good to do something real. Something that exists outside of screens and expectations.\n\nThank you for cheering me on. It genuinely means more than you probably realize. I’ll definitely keep you updated as things become clearer — and I hope you’ll do the same as your van slowly turns from an idea into reality.\n\nWarmest regards,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n读到你的消息时，我确实停顿了一会儿——这感觉很好。你对一切的描述让一切变得轻松，仿佛事情真的在朝着好的方向发展，而不仅仅是随机发生。\n\n那个“咖啡车机场接送”的画面真的让我笑了。生活有时确实很小。你说得对——拉脱维亚和匈牙利确实是最有希望的选项，但我还不想让心跑得比头脑快。不过，能在不同国家之间有选择的感觉真的很不真实。几个月前，我还在希望有一扇门能为我打开。现在，我感觉像是站在一条走廊上，面前有几扇门，每扇门都通向不同的地方。\n\n不过，有一件事我之前没有完全提到。在进行了面试并仔细研究了细节后，我发现这些奖学金大多数都是50%资助的。这意味着我还需要自己承担剩下的一半，再加上生活费用，这比我预期的要快得多。相比之下，中国和马来西亚的大学确实更实惠，从所有选项来看，它们在经济上负担最轻——但即便如此，一旦到了那里，我仍然需要完全自给自足。理论上这是可能的，但会带来持续的压力，我不想在这么重要的一个新阶段开始时就已经感到压力重重。所以，我现在继续寻找的目标非常明确：找到一个全额奖学金。我希望开始大学生活时能专注于学习和成长，而不是为了生存而挣扎。\n\n除此之外，我还有一些令人兴奋的消息——我刚刚得到了一份薪水是我目前两倍的工作机会！我既兴奋又有点紧张。这感觉像是拼图中又一块落到了合适的位置，我想这将给我在规划大学生活时带来更多的稳定性。\n\n我非常感谢你提到9月不是“等待”，而是一个间隔年。我之前没有从这个角度看待过。这样想真的改变了一切。第一次，我不再觉得自己落后或迟到了——我感到自己是有目的的。我有时间工作而不至于精疲力尽，有时间存钱，有时间训练，通过拳击建立自律，还有时间在进入大学生活前进行心理上的调整。这实际上是一种特权，而不是一种挫折。\n\n你提到的关于身体连接的话真的触动了我。用身体做些什么——无论是击打沙袋还是亲手建造什么东西——都有一种扎根的感觉。在经历了那么多思考、担忧和规划之后，做一些真实的事情感觉很好。这些事情存在于屏幕和期望之外。\n\n感谢你的鼓励。这真的比你想象的更有意义。我会在事情变得更加明朗时继续向你更新——也希望你会在你的咖啡车慢慢从一个想法变成现实时与我分享。\n\n最温暖的问候，\nMoni",

    "content": "Hi Lamine ☺️,\n\nIt is always good to hear from you.\nFirst of all—the new motorcycle looks seriously cool! That Apache has a really strong presence.\n\nSeeing it actually brought back some memories for me. The last time I rode a manual transmission motorcycle (with a clutch) was way back in middle school. My dad used to manage a driving school, so even though I was underage, I was able to ride around the practice lot in circles.\nI know the clutch takes some getting used to, and that bike looks pretty heavy, so please be careful on the road!\n\nTo answer your question from the last letter: that black object is a continuous LED light. Unlike a flash that only bursts for a split second for photos, this light stays on constantly. It’s essential for shooting video because it lets me see exactly how the light and shadows fall in real-time.\n\nNow, regarding what you shared about your work and anxiety... I really want to offer you a different perspective.\nYou feel trapped by this \"permanent contract,\" but try to look at it this way: usually, a permanent contract means the company cannot easily fire you, not that you are forbidden from leaving them. It doesn't mean you have to work there until retirement, right?\n\nThere is a popular saying on the Chinese internet right now: \"Life's tolerance for error is greater than you imagine.\"\n\nThink of this job not as a cage, but as a safety net. It is there to ensure that in the absolute worst-case scenario, you have a stable income. It is a \"fallback,\" not a \"destination.\" Your life is definitely not forced to end in that office.\n\nI know our environments are very different, and I can't fully understand the pressure you face. But maybe you can try a little mental exercise: Ask yourself, \"What if?\"\n\nWhat if you simply stop praying when you don't want to? What if you refuse to marry? What are the actual consequences? Sometimes we feel like the world will end if we break the rules, but often, the consequences are bearable.\nThe world is huge, Lamine. Nothing can easily narrow your entire future down to just \"working one job until you die.\"\n\nPlease don't let this internal conflict consume you. I will always support you in chasing the life you actually want.\n\nTake care,\nDomino\n\n\nPS: I saw the photo—you look handsome! You truly deserve a life that is as happy and free as you hope for. ✊",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine ☺️，\n\n每次收到你的来信都让我很开心。\n首先——你的新摩托车看起来真的超酷！那辆 Apache 真的很有气势。\n\n看到它让我回想起了往事。我上次骑手动挡摩托车（带离合器的）还是在中学的时候。我爸爸当时管理一家驾校，所以我虽然年龄不够，但还是能在练习场里一圈一圈地骑。\n我知道离合器需要时间适应，而且那辆车看起来也挺重的，所以请务必在道路上小心！\n\n关于你上一封信里提到的问题：那个黑色的物体是一盏连续 LED 灯。与只在拍照时短暂闪光的闪光灯不同，这种灯是持续亮着的。它对拍摄视频非常重要，因为它让我能实时看到光线和阴影的效果。\n\n现在，关于你分享的工作和焦虑……我想给你提供一个不同的视角。\n你觉得自己被困在了这份“永久合同”中，但试着这样想：通常，永久合同意味着公司不能轻易解雇你，而不是你不能离开公司。这并不意味着你必须在那里工作到退休，对吧？\n\n现在中国互联网上有一句流行的话：“生活的容错率比你想象的要大得多。”\n\n把这份工作看作是一张安全网，而不是一个牢笼。它确保在最坏的情况下，你仍然有一份稳定的收入。这是一个“退路”，而不是“终点”。你的生活绝不会被迫在那个办公室结束。\n\n我知道我们的环境非常不同，我无法完全理解你所面临的压力。但也许你可以尝试一下心理练习：问问自己，“如果……会怎样？”\n\n如果你不想祈祷时就停止祈祷会怎样？如果你拒绝结婚会怎样？实际的后果是什么？有时候我们觉得如果打破规则，世界就会崩塌，但往往后果是可以承受的。\n世界很大，Lamine。没有什么能轻易将你的未来局限在“一辈子做一份工作”上。\n\n请不要让内心的冲突消耗你。我永远支持你追求你真正想要的生活。\n\n保重，\nDomino\n\n附：我看到了照片——你看起来真帅！你绝对值得拥有一个像你所希望的那样幸福和自由的生活。✊",

But knowing your history, I have a feeling Latvia or Hungary might be the real contenders here. Honestly, having options across three continents just proves how solid that 88% really is.

On my end, nothing much has changed, except that on Tuesday the agency gave me a new motorcycle (Apache). I've never ridden a motorcycle with a clutch before, and now I get stressed every time I have to hit the road. \n\nIn reality, what I'm feeling isn't fatigue, but rather enormous anxiety and depression. I feel like I'm stuck in this job forever, a job I don't like. When I was unemployed, part of me thought about leaving Mali, but now that I have a permanent contract at my father's old workplace, I tell myself that I'm going to stay here until I die, which means forcing myself to be someone I'm not, forcing myself to pray at prayer times in front of my colleagues, forcing myself to marry a woman, etc. Basically, I feel trapped.\n\nIf I had known I was going to get a new motorcycle, I wouldn't have spent money to repair the old one 😭.\nOhh, a flat tire is really annoying haha.\n\nWhat is a continuous LED light used for? Is it very important for photo or video shoots? I think they knew it was an LED light, so they didn't bother you.\n\nThank you very much, I'll try my best. Have a great start to the week.\nPS: a photo of my new motorcycle and me that I took at my friend's house yesterday.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nLamine 🥀",

I can picture it already: you, your boyfriend, a shiny EV van, and people lining up for coffee at a park or festival. Honestly, that’s the kind of project that feels alive. It’s not just about work; it’s about creating something tangible and meaningful from scratch. I admire how you’re taking the leap, and I have no doubt you’ll figure out every detail. Your marketing skills paired with his barista expertise sound like the perfect combo.\n\nMy search for universities is going well too. I already received some scholarships from Malaysia, Latvia, Hungary, and — believe it or not — China! The catch is that all of them start in the fall semester, so that will be next September. It feels good to see doors opening, even if the timeline is a little farther out than I expected.\n\nIt’s funny — while I’m building my schedule around part-time work to reset my rhythm, I also feel like I’m finally reclaiming the time I had lost for hobbies, self-improvement, and just breathing a little easier.

It wasn't just a business pitch; it was about the future. That conversation changed everything. So, the plan is a go. I’m setting the plan to buy an EV van and convert it. It’s going to be messy and difficult, but it’s going to be real. In months maybe.\n\nNow, SHARK MEAT?! That is wild. I have never eaten shark in my life. What is the texture like? Is it flaky like fish, or chewy like chicken?\n\nYour photos are actually really good, by the way. The vibe is so raw and lively. I noticed one of the shops has a Chinese name—\"Sun Li Bak Kut Teh\" (顺利肉骨茶). Is the owner Chinese? It feels so surreal and cool to see those familiar Hanzi characters glowing in the night on an island so far away from me.\n\nGrabbing sushi plates without checking the price is the ultimate luxury, honestly (Can't say I wont do the same XD). You deserved that feast. And please tell Nana that his judgmental side-eye is fully justified. Humans are annoying hahaha.\n\nMy current life is pleasantly feral. I stay up until 2 AM doing \"Vibe Coding\" (basically bullying AI to write code for me because my math sucks) something related to the coffee van proj and sleep until noon, or till morning if I need to drive my bf to work.\n\nI’m glad the mechanical team for your robot finally woke up. Keep pushing them. Can't wait to hear more about your project.\n\nTake care,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel！\n\n自由了！\n\n当我走出那栋大楼，呼吸着清冷的秋日空气时，我立刻想到了你的话。那一刻感觉太不真实了，就像重力突然停止了一秒。\n\n因为你一直鼓励我“进化”，现在有个大更新：我要做咖啡车了。\n\n几天前的晚上，我终于做出了决定。我和男友坐在车里，停在黑暗中，聊了几个小时——关于恐惧、计划，以及建立真正属于我们自己的东西的渴望。那不是一次简单的商业讨论，而是关于未来。那次谈话改变了一切。所以，计划正式启动了。我打算买一辆电动货车并进行改造。这将是一段混乱而艰难的过程，但一切都会成真，也许几个月后就能实现。\n\n现在，鲨鱼肉？！这太疯狂了。我这辈子从未吃过鲨鱼肉。它的口感是什么样的？像鱼一样松软，还是像鸡肉一样有嚼劲？\n\n顺便说一句，你的照片拍得真好。那种原始而生动的感觉真的很棒。我注意到有一家店的名字是“Sun Li Bak Kut Teh”（顺利肉骨茶）。店主是中国人吗？看到那些熟悉的汉字在夜色中发光，感觉真的很不真实，也很酷。\n\n老实说，不看价格就拿寿司盘子，这绝对是终极奢侈（我也忍不住会这么做XD）。你值得那顿盛宴。请告诉Nana，他的侧眼凝视是完全有道理的。人类确实很烦人哈哈哈。\n\n我目前的生活很惬意，有点野性。我通常会熬夜到凌晨2点，进行“氛围编程”（基本上是逼迫AI帮我写代码，因为我数学不好），做一些与咖啡车项目相关的事情，然后睡到中午，或者如果需要送男友上班的话，就睡到早上。\n\n很高兴你的机器人项目的机械团队终于开始行动了。继续推动他们。迫不及待想听到更多关于你的项目的进展。\n\n保重，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nFirst of all — Boxing?! That is honestly so cool. It fits you perfectly. I can totally see you thriving in a boxing ring. It’s a great way to clear your head. Just promise me you won’t show up to your first day of university with a black eye! 😂\n\nYou’re right about us being in parallel situations. It feels like we both hit a \"reset\" button at the same time, and now we’re slowly building a new operating system for our lives, can't agree more.\n\nSince you shared your new plan, I should tell you about mine. Now that I’m free from the office, I’ve decided to start a project I’ve been dreaming about for a while: A Mobile Coffee Van.\n\nMy boyfriend is a barista, and his dream has always been to open a shop. Renting a physical store is too risky and expensive right now, but I realized... I can build a car. My plan is to buy an EV van and convert the trunk into a mobile coffee bar. We can drive it to markets, music festivals, or just park it by the lake. It’s also a test for myself. I want to see if my marketing skills can actually support a real, independent business from scratch. It’s scary, but way more exciting than making PowerPoints for clients.\n\nSo, while you are training your body in the gym, I’ll be figuring out how to fit a coffee machine (and a desk for it) into a car trunk. Let’s see who makes progress faster.\n\nFingers crossed for your university offers. The waiting part is always the hardest, but with an 88% (and that 95% in math!), I’m sure you’ll have plenty of doors opening for you.\n\nBest of luck, \nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n首先——拳击？！这真的太酷了。这非常适合你。我完全可以想象你在拳击场上大放异彩的样子。这确实是一个很好的方式来清理你的思绪。不过，你得答应我，不要在大学开学第一天带着黑眼圈出现！😂\n\n你说得对，我们确实处于平行的情境中。感觉我们都在同一时间按下了“重置”按钮，现在正在慢慢地为我们的生活构建一个新的操作系统，我完全同意。\n\n既然你分享了你的新计划，我也应该告诉你我的。现在我从办公室解脱出来，我决定开始一个我一直梦想的项目：移动咖啡车。\n\n我的男朋友是一名咖啡师，他的梦想一直是开一家咖啡店。现在租一个实体店面风险太大，费用也太高，但我意识到……我可以改装一辆车。我的计划是买一辆电动货车，然后把后车厢改造成一个移动咖啡吧。我们可以把它开到市场、音乐节，或者只是停在湖边。这对我来说也是一个考验。我想看看我的营销技能是否真的能从零开始支撑一个独立的生意。这很可怕，但比为客户做PPT要激动得多。\n\n所以，当你在健身房锻炼身体时，我将研究如何把咖啡机（和一张桌子）装进车尾箱。让我们看看谁的进展更快。\n\n祝你大学录取顺利。等待的过程总是最难的，但凭借88%的成绩（数学95%！），我相信你会有很多机会的。\n\n祝你好运，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hi Domino! ☺️\n\nWelcome back to Nanjing! 欢迎回家！(Welcome home!)\n\nFirst of all DOMINO! OH MY GOD! 🎉🎉🎉\n\nI am SO incredibly proud of you! 我真的为你感到骄傲！(I'm really proud of you!) You did it. You actually listened to your body and made the decision that needed to be made. Yesterday, you officially broke up with your office partner and walked out of that depressing building for the last time. Do you know how HUGE that is?!\n\nThat moment you described  深呼吸秋天的冷空气 (taking a deep breath of cold autumn air), realizing you don't have to go back there tomorrow, feeling surreal and scary but mostly just incredibly light... Domino, that's freedom. 那是自由 (that is freedom). I'm so, so happy for you. You chose yourself. You chose your health, your peace, your life. And you're still continuing the jewelry project on your own terms, which means you didn't give up on your work you just refused to let it destroy you. 这是完美的决定 (this is the perfect decision).\n\nI'm confident that the decision you made was well-considered and thought through carefully. 你一定想了很多 (you must have thought a lot about this). And I believe you chose what's best for you. Now, no more office-job syndrome! 希望你的头痛和胃痛也会离开 (I hope your headaches and stomach issues leave too). Your body will thank you for finally listening. 💙\n\nAbout the Hong Kong exhibition wow, that sounds absolutely brutal. Working until 1-2 AM every night, waking up at dawn, barely any sleep... 太累了 (so exhausting). I'm glad it was the final one of the year, because honestly, you needed that break. But the photos you sent? 香港看起来太美了！(Hong Kong looks so beautiful!) The skyline, the modern buildings, the street scenes at night, that sunset with the iconic tower... everything looks incredible. Hong Kong really is stunning, even if the work there was chaos.\n\nNow rest, Domino. 好好休息 (rest well). You've earned every moment of doing absolutely nothing. 你应该放松 (you should relax). Your body and mind need this recovery time after everything the exhibition, the big decision, all of it. Take care of yourself, okay?\n\nAbout the sushi feast hahaha, okay I have to come clean! 😂 I was SO hungry that day that I didn't even look at the menu properly. I just... grabbed whatever passed by on the conveyor belt! 我太饿了 (I was so hungry) hahaha. That's how I ended up spending USD $18.01 I just kept eating without thinking! 😅 But honestly? It was worth every cent. You're absolutely right: sometimes treating yourself solo without having to make conversation is the best therapy. 非常治愈 (very healing). I just sat there, ate my sushi, enjoyed the peace, and felt like a king haha.\n\nAbout the B- thank you for saying that. 你说得对 (you're right). There's no such thing as perfection in this world, and I did my best. 我已经尽力了 (I already did my best). I got A's in four other subjects, and honestly, that's something to celebrate. One B- doesn't take away from the victory. I'm fine with it!\n\nNana update: YES, I tried the tail tap trick! 😂 His reaction was HILARIOUS. He looked at me with this expression like, \"What is this human doing tapping my butt? Ugh, this is what I get for hanging out with humans\" complete with the most judgmental side-eye I've ever seen from a cat! 太搞笑了 (so funny)! But yeah, Nana definitely has a chaotic side. Soft name, chaotic personality. That's cats for you haha.\n\nAbout the introvert vs extrovert thing I totally understand! 我明白 (I understand). Some people really do need that dark room and zero human interaction to recharge. 那是他们最舒服的地方 (that's their most comfortable place). For me, it's the opposite, but I get it. We all have our own ways of recovering energy, and that's okay! 每个人都不一样 (everyone is different).\n\nRobot project update: The mechanical team finally woke up! 他们终于开始工作了 (They finally started working)! We're making progress now, so things are moving forward. I'll keep you posted as we get closer to finishing!\n\nOh! And I have a little adventure to share with you! 几天前 (A few days ago), I visited a friend in Tanjung Pinang, which is on the island next to where I live. 我去那里玩 (I went there to hang out) because honestly, I was getting bored of my city haha. We went to this street food place called \"Akau\" that sells Chinese food, and Domino I tried SHARK MEAT for the first time! 鲨鱼肉！(Shark meat!) And it was SO GOOD! 太好吃了 (so delicious)! I'm attaching some photos from my trip so you can see. It was such a fun little escape.\n\nAnyway, I'm just so happy for you, Domino. This is the beginning of something better. 新的开始 (a new beginning). You're free now. Breathe that cold autumn air, rest, recover, and when you're ready, step into whatever comes next on your own terms.\n\nTake care of yourself. 你值得最好的 (You deserve the best). 💙\n\nBest,  \nKel",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nThank you for your message — it really made me smile. 😄 I still can’t quite believe the 95% in Basic Maths myself; I had to double-check it several times to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. Your “complicated” relationship with math made me laugh — I totally get it! Numbers can be tricky friends, sometimes cruel, sometimes rewarding, and when they finally cooperate, it feels like a little victory over life itself.\n\nI’m really happy to hear you’re settling into a better rhythm with your work. I feel the same. My new part-time WFH job is perfect for this period of my life — just four hours a day, enough to cover my needs while still giving me the freedom to breathe, focus on my hobbies, and reclaim the pieces of life that got pushed aside when I was working full-time. It already feels like a weight has been lifted. I think this reset is exactly what I needed to start the new year strong and with some balance. Your jewelry project sounds ideal too — meaningful work that doesn’t consume all your energy — that’s the dream.\n\nI also loved the photos you sent from Hong Kong! The city looks chaotic, alive, and full of energy. I can almost feel the buzz through the pictures — the lights, the crowds, the movement. Somehow, the chaos looks beautiful, and I can see why it inspired clarity for you.\n\nAnd the certificate… I still pinch myself when I think about my 88%! It feels surreal. The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of applying to universities and scholarships, going back and forth with documents, and juggling all the details. But I’ve already received a couple of replies, and now I’m waiting to hear from the rest so I can carefully weigh all my options. It’s exciting and overwhelming, but it also feels like a real step forward — a door opening to the future.\n\nYour story about “Vibe Coding” sounds amazing! AI-assisted coding is something I’ve been curious about, and I love how immersive it is for you. Staying up late and being able to sleep in guilt-free — that kind of freedom is addictive, isn’t it? 😄 It’s the kind of freedom that makes the long, exhausting days worth it.\n\nI feel a bit like we’re in parallel situations now — both figuring out how to balance work, personal growth, and the little joys that make life feel full. Reading about your journey inspires me, and honestly, it reminds me that it’s possible to create a life that doesn’t just feel tolerable but meaningful.\n\nOh, and I’m thinking of joining a boxing class near my area this new year! I feel like it could be a great way to get moving, clear my head, and push myself physically. Plus, it’ll be something new to focus on alongside my studies and part-time work — a little mix of discipline, energy, and fun.\n\nI hope the coming weeks treat you gently. May you have the energy to rest, the space to enjoy the things that matter, and the freedom to create and explore without the constant weight of an office pressing down. I feel like we’re both starting new chapters — ones that feel more intentional and alive.\n\nTake care, and thank you again for your encouragement. It really means a lot.\n\nWarmly,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n感谢你的来信——它真的让我笑了。😄 我自己也难以置信基础数学能考到95%，我反复检查了好几次，确保自己不是在做梦。你和数学的“复杂”关系让我忍俊不禁——我完全理解！数字有时候像朋友一样，既难缠又令人欣慰，当它们终于配合时，感觉就像是对生活的小小胜利。\n\n很高兴听到你工作节奏变得更好了。我也有同感。我的新兼职在家工作非常适合我目前的生活阶段——每天只需工作四小时，既能满足我的需求，又让我有时间呼吸、专注于爱好，重新找回那些在全职工作时被忽略的生活片段。感觉就像卸下了一副重担。我觉得这种重启正是我需要的，以更平衡的状态迎接新的一年。你的珠宝项目听起来也很理想——有意义的工作，不会耗尽你的全部精力——这正是梦想中的生活。\n\n我还非常喜欢你从香港发来的照片！这座城市看起来混乱、充满活力，充满了生机。我几乎能从照片中感受到那种热闹的氛围——灯光、人群、流动。不知为何，这种混乱显得如此美丽，我明白它为什么能给你带来清晰的灵感。\n\n至于证书……每当我想到88%的成绩，我都会捏捏自己。感觉太不真实了。过去的几周里，我一直在申请大学和奖学金，来回处理文件，处理各种细节。但已经收到了几封回复，现在我正等待其他回复，以便仔细权衡所有选择。这既令人兴奋又让人感到压力，但这也像是向前迈出的一步——一扇通往未来的门被打开了。\n\n你提到的“氛围编码”听起来太棒了！我一直对人工智能辅助编码很感兴趣，喜欢你描述的那种沉浸感。熬夜工作，然后毫无内疚地睡懒觉——这种自由真是令人上瘾，对吧？😄 这种自由让那些漫长而疲惫的日子变得值得。\n\n我觉得我们现在的处境有些相似——都在努力平衡工作、个人成长和那些让生活充满意义的小快乐。读你的故事激励了我，老实说，它提醒了我，创造一种不仅仅是能忍受，而是有意义的生活是可能的。\n\n哦，对了，我打算在新的一年里加入附近的拳击班！我觉得这会是一个很好的方式，既能锻炼身体，又能清理思绪，还能挑战自己。此外，这将是我学习和兼职工作之外的一个新焦点——一种纪律、活力和乐趣的结合。\n\n希望接下来的几周对你温柔以待。愿你有精力休息，有空间享受重要的事物，有自由去创造和探索，而不会被办公室的重压所束缚。我觉得我们都在开启新的篇章——更加有意图和活力的篇章。\n\n保重，再次感谢你的鼓励。这真的意义重大。\n\n温暖地，\n莫妮",

That disconnect can make everything feel even lonelier. I’m not a professional, but I’m here. Is this just a slow buildup of exhaustion, or did something specific trigger this wave recently? If you want to talk about it, I’m listening.\n\nAnd yeah, the physical pain of spending money on repairs is real. I feel for your wallet. My car actually decided to join the club a couple of days ago—I picked up a nail in one of the tires. I had to rush to the shop to get it patched. It wasn't a huge fortune, but it’s just another annoying reminder that vehicles are basically endless maintenance pits. We fix them, they break, we pay, repeat.\n\nAs for that black object in the photo—it’s actually a continuous LED light. The reason I was so nervous about security is its size. The body alone is about the size of my forearm, and with that huge Fresnel lens attached to the front, it looks massive—almost like some kind of industrial weapon. I was convinced they’d stop me and ask a million questions. But surprisingly, even when I flew back to Nanjing, security didn’t care at all. I guess I worried for nothing.\n\nTake it slow, Lamine.

My relationship with math has always been… let’s just say, \"complicated.\" In fact, it was so bad that when I chose my university major, my number one criterion was: \"Does this require Advanced Calculus?\" If the answer was yes, I skipped it immediately. 🤣 So seeing that score on your certificate is genuinely impressive to me. It shows you have a kind of logical brain that I might lack.\n\nI’m glad you’re finding your rhythm with the part-time work. It sounds like we are in a similar boat now. The jewelry project I kept is also very low-maintenance — it just takes up a tiny slice of my time, leaving me with enough energy to focus on what I actually want to build.\n\nSpeaking of which, I’ve been diving deep into \"Vibe Coding\" lately. It’s basically using AI to help write code for people like me who aren’t professional programmers. It’s addictive. I’ve been so absorbed in it that I accidentally stayed up until 2 AM a few nights in a row.\n\nBut the best part of not having an office job anymore? When I stay up that late, I can just guiltlessly sleep in until noon the next day. Freedom is dangerous, but it feels great.\n\nCongrats again on the 88%, Moni. That’s a huge win.

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nI’m really glad to hear you’re back in Nanjing. Reading about your week in Hong Kong, I can’t even imagine how exhausting it must have been — long days, late nights, and barely a moment to breathe. Honestly, anyone would’ve gone quiet after that. The fact that you handled everything and even found clarity through the chaos says a lot about your resilience.\n\nI’m proud of the way you ended things with your office partner. It wasn’t dramatic or loud, but it was intentional — and that takes courage. Walking away from something that drains you, while keeping the parts you love, is exactly the kind of clarity so many people chase forever. I can almost picture that feeling of lightness you described — like stepping back into a space that’s finally yours to control. You deserve that calm after so much chaos.\n\nAnd those photos you sent from Hong Kong — I really liked them. Even in the few moments you weren’t working, the city felt alive and vibrant through your eyes. There’s something in the way you notice little details that makes a place feel like more than just a city — it feels like a story unfolding around you.\n\nOn my end, things are slowly falling into place too. I’ve started a part-time work-from-home job, nothing that burns me out — just four hours a day, enough to keep a steady rhythm without stealing my energy. It’s been a relief to finally feel like I can control my schedule, work without constant exhaustion, and still have space for the things I care about. Somehow, the timing feels right. It’s like life pressed pause just long enough for me to reset, and now I can start the new year feeling a little steadier, a little more prepared.\n\nAnd I have some exciting news to share — I just received my high school certificate results, and I got an 88%! I nearly couldn’t believe it at first. The past few weeks have been a whirlwind — applying to universities, scholarships, back and forth, hoping for replies — but I’ve already heard from a few, and now it’s just a matter of weighing the options and choosing the best path. It feels like a real step forward, and honestly, it’s given me a lot of hope and motivation.\n\nI hope you can take a few days to rest now that you’re home, Domi. You’ve earned some quiet after all that work. And it’s inspiring to see someone carve out balance in the middle of chaos — it reminds me that even when life gets overwhelming, there’s always a way to find your own rhythm.\n\nTalk soon, friend\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n听说你回到南京，我真的很高兴。读到你在香港的那一周，我简直无法想象那会有多么疲惫——漫长的日子，深夜的工作，几乎没有片刻喘息的时间。老实说，任何人经历了这一切都会变得沉默。而你不仅应对了一切，还在混乱中找到了清晰的方向，这充分展示了你的韧性。\n\n我对你是如何结束与办公室伙伴的关系感到非常骄傲。这并不是一场戏剧性的分手，而是有意为之——这需要勇气。从那些让你疲惫不堪的事情中抽身，同时保留你所热爱的部分，正是许多人一生都在追求的那种清晰。我几乎能想象出你描述的那种轻松感——仿佛重新回到了一个你能够掌控的空间。经历了那么多混乱之后，你值得拥有这份平静。\n\n还有你从香港发来的照片，我非常喜欢。即使在你工作之余的短暂时光里，这座城市通过你的眼睛依然显得生机勃勃。你对细节的敏锐观察，让一个地方不仅仅是一座城市，而更像是一个正在你周围展开的故事。\n\n至于我这边，事情也在慢慢步入正轨。我开始了一份兼职在家工作的职位，不会让我感到疲惫——每天只需工作四小时，足以保持稳定的节奏，而不会耗尽我的精力。终于能够掌控自己的时间表，工作而不感到持续的疲惫，同时还有空间去做我关心的事情，这让我感到如释重负。不知为何，时机似乎刚刚好。生活仿佛按下了暂停键，让我有时间重置，现在我可以带着更稳定、更准备好的心态迎接新的一年。\n\n我还有一个令人兴奋的消息要分享——我刚刚收到了高中毕业证书的成绩，是88分！一开始我几乎不敢相信。过去的几周真是风风火火——申请大学、奖学金，来回奔波，期待回复——但我已经收到了几所大学的回复，现在只需要权衡选项，选择最佳的道路。这感觉像是一个真正的进步，老实说，这给了我很多希望和动力。\n\n希望你现在回家后能休息几天，多米。你工作了这么久，确实需要一些安静的时间。看到有人在混乱中找到平衡，真是令人鼓舞——这提醒我，即使生活变得让人难以招架，总有一种方式可以找到自己的节奏。\n\n很快再聊，朋友\n莫妮",

The truth is, I was in Hong Kong for the final jewelry exhibition of the year. It was absolute chaos. For several days straight, we were working until 1 or 2 AM, then waking up at the crack of dawn to head right back to the exhibition center. I barely had time to sleep, let alone write.\n\nBut the trip gave me exactly the clarity I needed.\n\nYesterday, I finally did it. I officially said goodbye to that office partner I told you about.\n\nYou mentioned in your last letter that my disappearance might make them realize I’m human. Well, I decided not to wait for them to figure it out. I just laid it out: I’m done with the office routine. There was no drama, no shouting. Just a quiet conversation, and then it was over.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not completely unemployed — the jewelry project (the one that took me to Hong Kong) is still ongoing. The difference is, I don’t have to sit in that depressing office anymore. I can handle the distribution and marketing on my own terms, from home, or a café, or wherever I want.\n\nWalking out of that building felt surreal. For the first time in a long time, the air felt lighter. I kept the work I enjoy, and cut out the \"office politics\" that were draining me. It feels like the balance I’ve been looking for.\n\nYou also asked about my health in your last letter — honestly, the adrenaline of the exhibition kept me going while I was in Hong Kong. I didn’t have time to feel sick. But now that I’m home and the adrenaline has worn off, I plan to take it easy for a few days.\n\nI’ve attached some photos I took in Hong Kong during the rare moments I wasn't working. It’s a chaotic city, but it has a strange kind of energy that I think you’d appreciate.\n\nI think we’ve spent enough letters talking about sickness, burnout, and stress. I’m ready to leave those topics in the past.\n\nHow has your “forced break” been treating you lately? Have you found a new rhythm, or are you still fighting the boredom?\n\nTalk soon, Domino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n我终于回到南京了。\n\n我知道过去一周我几乎没有消息，对此我感到很抱歉。事实上，我一直在香港参加今年最后的珠宝展览。那真是忙得不可开交。连续几天，我们工作到凌晨一两点，然后天刚亮就起床赶回展览中心。我几乎没有时间睡觉，更不用说写信了。\n\n但这次旅行给了我所需要的清晰。\n\n昨天，我终于做到了。我正式和你提到过的那个办公室搭档告别了。\n\n你在上一封信中提到，我的消失可能会让他们意识到我是有血有肉的人。好吧，我决定不等他们自己意识到这一点。我直接摊牌了：我不再忍受办公室的例行公事。没有争吵，没有大喊大叫。只是一次平静的谈话，然后一切就结束了。\n\n需要澄清的是，我并不是完全失业——那个带我去香港的珠宝项目还在继续。不同的是，我不必再坐在那个令人沮丧的办公室里。我可以按照自己的方式处理分销和营销，无论是从家里、咖啡馆，还是任何我想去的地方。\n\n走出那栋大楼时，感觉像是在做梦。很久以来，空气第一次变得轻松。我保留了我喜欢的工作，摆脱了那些让我疲惫不堪的“办公室政治”。这正是我一直寻找的平衡。\n\n你在上一封信中还问到我的健康状况——说实话，展览的肾上腺素让我在香港时一直保持活力。我没有时间感到不适。但现在回到家里，肾上腺素消退了，我打算休息几天。\n\n我附上了一些在香港工作间隙拍摄的照片。那是一个充满混乱的城市，但有一种奇怪的能量，我想你会欣赏的。\n\n我觉得我们已经花了太多信件谈论疾病、疲惫和压力。我准备好把这些话题留在过去。\n\n你最近的“被迫休息”怎么样？你找到新的节奏了吗，还是仍在与无聊作斗争？\n\n期待你的回信，多米诺",

It was absolute chaos, working until 1 or 2 AM every night, then waking up at dawn to head back to the venue. I barely had time to sleep, let alone write.\n\nBut I have some big news to share. You said in your last letter, \"Your body is speaking.\" You were right. And I finally decided to listen.\n\nYesterday, I officially broke up with my office partner.\n\nI didn’t quit the jewelry project itself (that’s still ongoing, and I can handle it on my own terms), but I ended the partnership that required me to sit in that depressing office every day. I walked out of that building, took a deep breath of the cold autumn air, and realized I don’t have to go back there tomorrow. It feels… surreal. A little scary, maybe, but mostly just incredibly light.\n\nSo, no more \"office-job syndrome\" for me. Hopefully, my headaches and stomach issues will get the memo and leave too.\n\nNow, let’s talk about important things: The Sushi Feast! 🍣 USD $18.01?! Wow, you really went all out! For a student budget, that is absolutely a king’s meal. I’m glad you enjoyed it solo — sometimes, treating yourself without having to make conversation is the best form of therapy. You deserved every bite of it after exam season.\n\nAnd hey, a B- in one subject? That is totally fine. Perfection is boring anyway. You got A’s in four others, which is amazing. Don't let one grade take away from the victory.\n\n\"Nana\" is a very cute name! It sounds soft, but knowing cats, I’m sure he has a chaotic side too. Did you try the \"tail tap\" trick I mentioned last time? I'm curious if he enjoyed it or looked at you with total confusion. 😂\n\nIt’s funny that you recharge by going to more crowded places. That sounds exhausting to me! If I’m drained, I need a dark room and zero human interaction. But I guess that’s your superpower — feeding off the collective energy of a crowd.\n\nI’m going to spend the next few days doing absolutely nothing but resting and recovering from the Hong Kong trip.\n\nKeep me posted on the robot project (hope the mechanical team finally wakes up!).\n\nBest, Domino",

I can understand how frustrating it must be — especially when your environment doesn’t feel like it fits you, and you’re surrounded by people who don’t understand your rhythm. It must be even harder when you’re just trying to get by and make the best of it, but I know you’ve got so much more to offer than just being stuck in a job that doesn’t challenge you. I hope you’ll find a way to make it work for now, but also leave room for something better, something that makes you feel more you.\n\nYou definitely deserve to be in a place that values you. I know it can be hard to break free from situations like that, but remember — you’re not defined by that job. You’re so much more than that!\n\nAnd I completely get your worry about Yoshi. It must be terrifying knowing that he’s so trusting of everyone, and that not everyone has the best intentions. I hope he stays safe and happy, and I bet he’s loving all the attention you give him. I imagine he’s quite the little character — the kind that makes you smile even when things aren’t going well.\n\nAs for me, I had a bit of an adventure today. I’m back in Hong Kong for a short business trip, but something funny happened when I was leaving. I accidentally brought a photography light with a battery (which is technically not allowed to go through security), but the security staff didn’t even bat an eye! It honestly felt like the world’s biggest mess of a backstage operation. 😂 Sometimes I can’t help but think that things are way more chaotic than they appear.\n\nI hope things get better for you, Lamine. I know this is a tough moment, but I really believe you’ll come through it and find something that suits you better. And if you need to vent or talk, I’m always here to listen.\n\nTake care,\nDomino 🐈‍⬛",

That weekend sounds like it hit you out of nowhere. Even if the doctors didn’t find anything major, inflammation plus a sudden fever can really knock a person out. I’m relieved you took the time to rest, even if it wasn’t planned.\n\nI’m glad you’re mostly back to normal now, though I get how frustrating it is when your stomach or digestion still feels “off.” Sometimes the body needs a bit longer to settle down, even after the worst part is over. Just take things slow for a bit — no need to rush back into full speed when your system is clearly telling you to breathe.\n\nAbout the project, I completely get the position you’re in. It’s hard to step away from something when you feel like everyone expects you to handle everything. But honestly, you disappearing for a few days might actually be the thing that makes your partner realize you’re human, not a machine. The Hong Kong trip might give you the perfect window to let things transition naturally. Your plan sounds solid — no confrontation, no drama, just a shift that happens on its own.\n\nI also really appreciate you updating me despite everything that’s been happening. It means a lot. Just take care of yourself first — everything else can wait. And I hope the Hong Kong trip goes smoothly and maybe even gives you a bit of freshness after such a tiring week.\n\nKeep me posted when you can.

I hate this job; I'm just a lackey. What's more, in the office where I work, I don't even have a desk. I just have a chair without armrests in a corner next to a cabinet, and I have nothing in common with the other two people in the office. One is 60 and the other is in his forties. They spend the day on Facebook and TikTok with the volume turned up so loud that I'm forced to listen to things I don't want to hear. I'm forced to pray during prayer times. On top of that, a lot of people there know my father, so I have to put on a good face. \n\nOh yes, Yoshi's fur is very soft, it feels like a stuffed animal when you pick him up 🤩, but I'm really scared for Yoshi, I'm afraid someone will kill him.

That's commitment to the craft right there! But honestly, mad respect for still taking photos even when your social battery is flashing red. That's真的很厉害 (really amazing) — you're out there documenting everyone's joy even when you're running on fumes. \n\nI find it fascinating how differently we recharge though! You mentioned needing alone time after all that social interaction, and I totally get it — but here's the funny part: when MY battery dies? I usually... go somewhere MORE crowded hahaha. 为什么我这样 (Why am I like this)? I think being around that chaotic energy actually helps me reset somehow. Maybe that's the classic extrovert thing, but yeah, we're definitely operating on different charging systems 😅\n\nAbout the whole \"Paman\" situation — I really appreciate you looking out for me, seriously. And you're right to be concerned! But just to clarify: they're not actually dependent on me in that way. It's more like... they borrow money from me? Like with the laptop situation, my girl borrowed money and she'll pay me back eventually. So it's not as危险 (dangerous) as it might sound, though I totally understand why it could look that way from the outside. Your concern means a lot though, genuinely 💙\n\nOH AND THE GRADES UPDATE: so the remaining results came in and... I got a B- in one subject hahaha. But honestly? 没关系 (It's okay)! Not everything has to be perfect, right? The important thing is I did my best, and most of them turned out well. Can't win them all! 🎯\n\nThe robot project is *almost* there — I'm currently in waiting mode while my mechanical team member finishes their part. You know how group projects go... 等待中 (waiting mode activated) 😂\n\nAbout the cat butt situation — thank you SO much for explaining that! I genuinely had no idea if he was showing affection or just being disrespectful hahaha. I'm definitely going to try the tail-tap technique you mentioned. And yes, I finally named him! His name is Nana. 可不可爱 (Isn't that adorable)? I think it fits him perfectly, even if his favorite activity is still parking his butt near my face 🙃\n\nBut more importantly — how are you feeling NOW? I'm so sorry I didn't respond quickly (forgive me for that!). Are the headaches and stomach issues any better? I hope your boyfriend isn't too worried about you. That whole burnt-out-from-9-to-5 feeling sounds absolutely exhausting, and honestly, your body might genuinely be telling you something important. 你的身体在说话 (Your body is speaking). I really hope you're taking time to rest properly during this time, especially if the flu is going around. Please take care of yourself 💚\n\nAlso — SUSHI UPDATE: I finally did it! Went solo as planned and absolutely destroyed USD $18.01 worth of sushi hahahaha. That's literally the most I've ever spent on a single meal for myself, but you know what? 值得 (Worth it). Sometimes you just need to treat yourself after exam season, right? No regrets whatsoever 🍣\n\nOh! And I need to apologize for taking forever to reply — I had a bunch of gatherings and events with friends recently that kept me super busy. I'm actually going to send you some photos from those! 很热闹 (Very lively) and chaotic in the best way possible.\n\nI hope things ease up for you soon, that the sickness passes quickly, and that you find some breathing room in your schedule. And hey, if the 9-to-5 really isn't working for you long-term, maybe your body's rebellion is worth listening to? \n\nTake care of yourself, okay? \n\nBest,  \nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino！☺️\n\n好的，先说最重要的——那个便携式桑拿房的描述简直让我笑崩了😂 我一直在想象那些穿着毛绒服的人，就像随身带着空调一样，里面装着风扇，随意地走来走去。这简直就是对爱好的极致追求！但说实话，真的很佩服你，即使社交能量已经快耗尽，你仍然坚持拍照。这真的太厉害了——你在外记录每个人的快乐，即使自己已经精疲力尽。\n\n我发现我们充电的方式真的大不相同！你提到在那么多社交互动之后需要独处时间，我完全理解——但有趣的是：当我的能量耗尽时，我通常……会去更拥挤的地方哈哈哈。我为什么会这样呢？我觉得那种混乱的能量实际上能帮助我重新充电。也许这就是典型的外向性格吧，但确实，我们的充电系统确实不同😅\n\n关于“Paman”的情况——我真的非常感谢你为我着想，真的。你担心是对的！但为了澄清：他们并不是真的依赖我。更像是……他们向我借钱？就像电脑那件事，我的朋友借了钱，她最终会还给我的。所以并没有听起来那么危险，虽然我完全理解从外面看可能会觉得这样。但你的关心真的让我很感动，真心的💙\n\n哦，还有成绩更新：剩下的成绩出来了……我在一个科目上得了B-哈哈哈。但说实话？没关系！不是每件事都必须完美，对吧？重要的是我尽力了，而且大多数成绩都不错。不可能每件事都赢！🎯\n\n机器人的项目也*快*完成了——我现在处于等待模式，等着我的机械组员完成他们的部分。你知道，小组项目就是这样……等待模式已启动😂\n\n关于猫屁股的情况——真的非常感谢你的解释！我真心不知道他是表示亲昵还是不尊重哈哈哈。我肯定会试试你提到的尾巴轻拍技巧。对了，我终于给他起名字了！他的名字叫Nana。可爱不？我觉得这个名字非常适合他，即使他最喜欢的活动还是把屁股停在我脸上😂\n\n但更重要的是——你现在感觉怎么样？真的很抱歉我没有及时回复（请原谅我！）。头痛和胃部问题好些了吗？希望你的男朋友不会太担心你。那种从早九晚五的疲惫感听起来真的太累了，说实话，你的身体可能真的在告诉你一些重要的事情。你的身体在说话。我真的希望你在这段时间里能好好休息，尤其是如果流感正在流行。请一定要照顾好自己💚\n\n还有——寿司更新：我终于做到了！按计划独自去了一趟，花了18.01美元的寿司，简直吃个精光哈哈哈。这是我为自己花过的最多的一顿饭，但你知道吗？值得。有时候，考试季结束后，真的需要犒劳一下自己，对吧？完全没有后悔的感觉🍣\n\n哦！我还需要为回复得这么慢道歉——最近我参加了很多聚会和活动，非常忙。我打算给你发一些照片！非常热闹，而且混乱得恰到好处。\n\n希望你的情况能快点好转，病快点好起来，日程也能稍微轻松一些。而且，如果朝九晚五的工作真的长期不适合你，也许你身体的反抗值得倾听？\n\n照顾好自己，好吗？\n\n最好的祝福，  \nKel",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nI’m really sorry for taking so long to reply — I’ve been feeling a bit under the weather. Last weekend was pretty rough for me. On Friday, I went to the hospital for a checkup, and the blood tests showed that there was some inflammation in my body. The doctor said it wasn’t anything major and just recommended rest at home, without even prescribing any medication. But of course, that night I ended up with a fever. I spent the entire weekend at home, barely able to get out of bed, popping paracetamol and antibiotics. By Monday, I was feeling a bit better, and now I think I’m pretty much back to normal… maybe. My digestive system still feels a little off, though. I’m not really sure what to do about it, especially since I went to one of the best hospitals in the city, and they didn’t find anything major. So, I guess I’ll just keep an eye on it.\n\nAs for the project I mentioned, I haven’t talked to my partner about stepping away just yet. Next week, I have a business trip to Hong Kong for another project. Maybe my disappearance this week will make him realize that I’m not as irreplaceable as he might think, and by then I can smoothly exit the project. That’s the plan, at least.\n\nI really appreciate your patience in waiting for my reply, and I’m glad to finally update you. I’ve been trying to rest and recover, but life always has a way of keeping you busy. I’ll keep you posted on how things go.\n\nTake care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing from you again soon.\n\nWarm regards,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n非常抱歉这么久才回复你——我最近身体不太舒服。上周末对我来说非常艰难。周五我去医院做了一次检查，血液检测显示我体内有些炎症。医生说问题不大，只是建议我回家休息，甚至没有开药。但那天晚上我发烧了。整个周末我几乎都在家里，几乎不能下床，只能吃扑热息痛和抗生素。到了周一，我感觉稍微好些了，现在我觉得自己差不多恢复了……也许吧。不过我的消化系统还是有点不舒服。我也不确定该怎么办，毕竟我已经去了市里最好的医院，他们也没有发现什么大问题。所以，我想我只能继续观察了。\n\n至于我提到的那个项目，我还没有和我的合作伙伴谈过退出的事。下周我有一个去香港的商务旅行，是另一个项目。也许我这一周的“消失”会让他意识到我并不是那么不可替代，到那时我就可以顺利退出项目了。至少这是我的计划。\n\n非常感谢你耐心等待我的回复，也很高兴终于能向你更新我的情况。我一直在努力休息和恢复，但生活总是有办法让你忙碌起来。我会随时向你汇报进展。\n\n保重身体，期待很快再次收到你的消息。\n\n温暖的问候，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nThe layoff still feels strange. Not painful, just… hollow, it's been 2 weeks already, and it felt like yesterday, like someone suddenly turned off all the background noise I got used to living with. It’s a weird feeling — the body is relieved, but the mind doesn’t know what to do with the silence. One moment, I was caught in the routine, even though it was draining me day by day, and the next moment, everything went still. And in that stillness, I realized how close I was to burning out completely without even noticing.\n\nThinking about it more, maybe you’re right — maybe this wasn’t a setback but a forced stop before something inside me broke down. And with university coming in around three months, the timing lines up in a way that feels almost intentional. Like life pushed everything out of my hands so I could breathe for a moment before the next chapter begins.\n\nWhen I look back at this year, the burnout makes sense. Working full-time completely destroyed my rhythm. I got home late every night, too tired to think, too tired to do anything I cared about. My sleep got ruined, my days felt compressed, and all the hobbies and routines that used to make me feel like myself slowly faded away. It’s strange how you don’t notice the damage until you finally step away from the noise.\n\nSo I decided that when I go to university, I’ll only work part-time. Enough to keep me going, but not enough to consume me again. I want to actually live through my uni years. Build better habits. Have time for the things I love. Grow in ways I couldn’t while being tied to a full-time schedule. It feels like choosing myself instead of choosing survival mode. I don’t know exactly how it’ll turn out, but it feels like the right direction — and for once, that gives me hope.\n\nYour weekend sounded familiar in a way that made me smile a little — that mix of joy and exhaustion. It’s the kind of thing where the moment itself is good, but the energy cost hits you afterward like a wave. And the car situation… yeah. Big responsibilities drain you twice: once with the time they take, and again with the money they demand. Especially when your energy is already stretched thin.\n\nWhat you said about your health really stuck with me. The headaches, the stomach pain, that heavy fatigue — it reads like your body rejecting the environment, not just some flu. That “office-job syndrome” is real in a way most people underestimate. You can sit in that routine for a long time, convincing yourself it’s normal, but the body always knows when something is wrong. Maybe it isn’t that you’re not built for structure. Maybe you’re just built for a freer kind of life, one where the rhythm is your own, not imposed by fluorescent lights and endless tasks.\n\nI’ve been dealing with my own kind of heaviness — not something sleep fixes, but a quiet weight that sits in the chest and doesn’t move. Since the layoff, some days feel peaceful, like I’m finally breathing again. Others feel directionless, like I’m floating without knowing where to land. But I’m starting to see that this is what transition feels like. Awkward, uncertain, uncomfortable — but also full of possibility if you give it time.\n\nHearing your story made everything feel less lonely. It’s strange how talking to someone going through their own shift makes your own shift feel more understandable. Like we’re both standing at the edge of the same threshold, trying to figure out the next step.\n\nI don’t know what the next months will bring for either of us, but I hope your health starts to settle. And if your body is telling you that you can’t keep pushing in that office until the end of the year, I really hope you listen to it. Sometimes the body sees the truth long before the mind catches up.\n\nDespite everything, I feel… hopeful. Not loudly hopeful, but quietly. The kind that grows slowly, the kind that comes from realizing that change isn’t always a loss — sometimes it’s just the start of something better, even if it begins with a tired heart.\n\nTake it easy on yourself, Domi.\nUntil next time, friend.\n\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n裁员的感觉依然很奇怪。不是痛苦，而是……空虚。已经过去两周了，却仿佛就在昨天，就像有人突然关掉了我习惯的生活背景音。这是一种奇怪的感觉——身体感到轻松，但心灵却不知道如何应对这份寂静。有一刻，我深陷于日常，尽管它日复一日地消耗着我，而下一刻，一切都静止了。在那片静谧中，我意识到自己几乎在不知不觉中就要彻底燃尽了。\n\n仔细想想，也许你是对的——这也许不是一次挫折，而是在我内心崩溃之前的一次被迫停顿。而随着三个月后大学生活的临近，时间的安排似乎有一种近乎刻意的巧合。仿佛生活把一切从我手中夺走，让我在下一章开始前有片刻的喘息。\n\n回顾这一年，燃尽的原因变得清晰起来。全职工作彻底打乱了我的节奏。每天晚上很晚才回家，累得无法思考，累得无法做任何我喜欢的事情。睡眠被破坏，日子变得压缩，所有曾经让我感到自我的爱好和习惯慢慢消失了。奇怪的是，直到你终于远离了那片喧嚣，你才会注意到那些伤害。\n\n所以，我决定上大学时只做兼职。足够维持生活，但不至于再次消耗我。我想真正度过我的大学时光。建立更好的习惯。有时间做我喜欢的事情。以一种在全职工作中无法实现的方式成长。这感觉像是选择了自己，而不是选择了生存模式。我不知道结果会怎样，但感觉这是正确的方向——至少这一次，这给了我希望。\n\n你周末的经历让我微笑，那种混合着快乐和疲惫的感觉。那一刻本身是美好的，但之后的能量消耗像海浪一样袭来。还有车的问题……是的。巨大的责任会让你感到双重疲惫：一次是时间上的消耗，一次是金钱上的需求。尤其是在你已经精力透支的情况下。\n\n你提到的健康问题让我深有感触。头痛、胃痛、那种沉重的疲劳——这像是你的身体在拒绝环境，而不仅仅是感冒。那种“办公室综合征”是真实存在的，大多数人对此估计不足。你可以长时间坐在那个环境中，说服自己这是正常的，但身体总是知道何时出了问题。也许问题不在于你不适合结构化的生活，而是你更适合一种更自由的生活，一种节奏由自己掌控，而不是被荧光灯和无尽的任务所强加的生活。\n\n我也在应对一种沉重感——不是睡眠能解决的，而是一种静静地坐在胸口、无法移动的重量。自从被裁员以来，有些日子感觉很平静，像是终于又能呼吸了。有些日子则感觉没有方向，像是在漂浮，不知道该落在哪里。但开始意识到，这就是过渡期的感觉。尴尬、不确定、不舒服——但如果你给它时间，它也充满了可能性。\n\n听到你的故事让我感到不那么孤独。奇怪的是，与一个正在经历自己转变的人交谈，会让你的转变显得更加可以理解。就像我们俩都站在同一个门槛上，试图弄清楚下一步该怎么做。\n\n我不知道接下来的几个月我们会面临什么，但希望你的健康状况能有所好转。如果你的身体告诉你，你无法继续在办公室里撑到年底，我真心希望你能听从它的建议。有时候，身体比心灵更早看到真相。\n\n尽管一切如此，我感到……充满希望。不是大声的希望，而是安静的。那种缓慢生长的希望，那种来自意识到变化并不总是意味着失去——有时它只是更好的开始，即使它始于一颗疲惫的心。\n\n对自己宽容一些，Domi。\n下次见，朋友。\n\nMoni",

But from what you described, it feels more like life forced a break on you before you burned yourself out. With university on the horizon, the timing might be less disastrous than it feels right now.\n\nThis past weekend I actually stepped out a little myself. A friend hosted a small furry gathering for his birthday, and I was invited to shoot photos for everyone. It was fun, but also tiring in that “social battery drains faster than expected” way. And the next day I spent nearly one-fifth of my monthly income at the 4S shop getting my car serviced — taking care of a big machine really is a time-consuming and money-consuming responsibility. Sometimes I wonder why I put myself through this.\n\nAs for me, I don’t know what’s going on with my health lately. I recovered from the cold, but now the headaches, stomach pain, and that heavy fatigue are back again. My boyfriend thinks it’s the new flu, but honestly I suspect it’s just the “office-job syndrome.” The more I sit in that office, the more resistant I become to the routine. I’m not sure I can hold on until the end of the year — maybe deep down I’m simply not built for this kind of life.

    "content": "Hi Kel ☺️\n\nI’m really glad you found the little gathering interesting. In the furry community, events like that happen regularly — sometimes it’s a small group renting an Airbnb, and sometimes the bigger ones even book full hotel venues. People put on their fursuits, interact with friends and strangers, take photos, joke around… it has this chaotic, joyful energy that’s hard to describe.\n\nAnd about your question — “Is it hot in there?”\nThe answer is: yes. extremely. absolutely yes. 😂\nInside a fursuit is basically a portable sauna, so most fursuiters keep small fans tucked inside just to survive. Without those, they’d probably evaporate.\n\nThe funny part is that I’m not actually great at handling such high-energy social environments. I’m a bit more introverted, so when I’m suddenly surrounded by a group of fursuiters asking for photos, my social battery drains almost instantly. 🥲\nBut when I later see them genuinely happy with the photos I took, it still feels worth it.\n\nYour Paman story is… honestly kind of adorable and kind of dangerous at the same time. I can picture how much they rely on you. If you’re comfortable being that “parent figure,” that’s sweet — just make sure they don’t lean on you too heavily, financially or emotionally. Kindness is precious, but boundaries are too.\n\nAnd your grades — seriously impressive.\nYou sound like someone who consistently performs at the very top without even showing it. I’m glad the results turned out well, and I hope the remaining ones matched your expectations too.\n\nI also saw the kitten photo you sent — he’s incredibly cute. ☺️\nFrom what I know, when a cat turns its butt toward you, it’s actually a sign of trust.\nIf he’s still a young one, there might even be a “motherly grooming request” hidden in that gesture.\nYou can try gently tapping the base of his tail next time — some cats love it, while others just walk away like nothing happened. It’s always a gamble.\n\nAs for me… I’m not feeling my best lately. First headaches, then stomach discomfort, then that washed-out kind of fatigue. My boyfriend thinks it might be the flu that’s going around, but I suspect it’s also a bit of office-job syndrome.\nI’m growing more resistant to the 9-to-5 routine, and sometimes I’m unsure if I can even make it to the end of the year. I guess I’ve always been someone who gravitates toward freedom, and maybe my body is just reacting to being boxed in.\n\nAnyway — I hope your week goes smoothly, that your “seven children” behave themselves, and that your long-awaited sushi feast ends up being the perfect reward after everything you’ve been juggling.\n\nTake care,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel ☺️\n\n很高兴你对那个小型聚会感兴趣。在毛绒圈里，这样的活动经常发生——有时是小团体租个Airbnb，有时大型活动甚至会预订整个酒店。人们穿上毛绒服，与朋友和陌生人互动，拍照，开玩笑……这种混乱而欢乐的氛围很难用言语描述。\n\n关于你的问题——“在里面热吗？”\n答案是：是的，非常非常热。😂\n穿毛绒服就像置身于一个便携式桑拿房，所以大多数毛绒服爱好者都会在里面放个小风扇以求生存。没有这些，他们可能都会蒸发掉。\n\n有趣的是，我其实并不擅长处理这种高能量的社交环境。我有点内向，所以当突然被一群毛绒服爱好者包围，请求拍照时，我的社交能量几乎瞬间耗尽。🥲\n但当我看到他们对我的照片感到真心高兴时，这一切还是值得的。\n\n你的Paman故事……老实说，既可爱又有点危险。我能想象他们有多么依赖你。如果你能舒适地扮演这个“家长”的角色，那真是太好了——但请确保他们不会在经济或情感上过于依赖你。善良是宝贵的，但界限也很重要。\n\n还有你的成绩——真的非常令人印象深刻。\n你听起来像是一个总是默默无闻地保持顶尖表现的人。我很高兴结果很好，也希望剩下的成绩也符合你的期望。\n\n我还看到了你发来的猫咪照片——他超级可爱。☺️\n据我所知，当猫把屁股对着你时，实际上是一种信任的标志。\n如果他还是一只小猫，这个动作可能还包含了一种“请求母猫梳理”的意思。\n下次你可以试着轻轻拍打他的尾巴根部——有些猫会喜欢，而有些猫则会像什么都没发生一样走开。这总是个赌博。\n\n至于我……最近状态不太好。先是头痛，然后是胃部不适，接着是那种疲惫不堪的感觉。我男朋友认为可能是流行的流感，但我怀疑也有些办公室综合症的因素。\n我越来越难以适应朝九晚五的生活，有时甚至不确定自己能否撑到年底。我想我一直是那种向往自由的人，也许我的身体只是在对被束缚作出反应。\n\n无论如何——希望你这一周顺利，你的“七个孩子”表现良好，你期待已久的寿司大餐能成为你应对一切事务后的完美奖励。\n\n保重，\nDomino",

    "content": "Hi Lamine,\n\nIt’s always such a joy to find your letter waiting for me. Thank you for what you said — you’re right about learning to value my own work. But instead of trying to negotiate for higher pay, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should let go of some of my projects in the future. It might be better to save my energy for the things I truly want to do, rather than constantly stretching myself thin just to earn a little more.\n\nThis weekend was quite full but nice. One of my friends held a small furry-themed birthday party and invited me to be the photographer. It was fun spending the afternoon surrounded by those adorable characters — a room full of fluff, laughter, and camera flashes. Then the next day I spent about one-fifth of my monthly income at the car dealership getting my car serviced 😩. Taking care of that big creature is such a demanding job; it eats both time and money.\n\nI really understand what you said about comparing yourself to others — that kind of feeling is so hard to avoid. But please don’t let it weigh on you too much. You’re just starting a new chapter, and even if the salary doesn’t seem fair now, your effort still matters. Every job is a step forward, and this one will give you the stability to build what comes next.\n\nBy the way, Yoshi looks amazing! His fur is so smooth and shiny — he seems to be doing really well. Debbie’s in the middle of changing into his winter coat; I can pull entire tufts of loose fur from his neck, and he looks like a giant dandelion now.\n\nGood luck with your first weeks at work, Lamine. I know it’s not easy, but you’re absolutely not “less than.” Keep going at your own pace — you’re doing just fine.\n\nTake care,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine，\n\n每次看到你的来信总是那么令人愉悦。谢谢你的话——你说得对，要学会珍视自己的工作。不过，与其努力争取更高的报酬，我一直在想，或许将来放弃一些项目会更好。把精力留给自己真正想做的事情，而不是为了多赚一点钱而不断拉伸自己，这样可能更好。\n\n这个周末过得非常充实而美好。一个朋友举办了一场以毛绒玩具为主题的生日派对，并邀请我担任摄影师。下午在那些可爱的玩偶中间度过，真是乐趣无穷——满屋子的绒毛、笑声和闪光灯。第二天，我在汽车经销商那里花掉了月收入的五分之一给我的车做保养 😩。照顾这个大家伙真是个费时又费钱的活儿。\n\n我非常理解你所说的那种与他人比较的感觉——这种感觉真的很难避免。但请不要让它成为你的负担。你正在开启新的篇章，即使现在的薪水看起来不太公平，你的努力仍然很重要。每一份工作都是向前迈出的一步，这份工作会给你带来稳定，为接下来的事情打下基础。\n\n对了，Yoshi 看起来很棒！他的毛发如此光滑亮丽——他似乎过得很好。Debbie 正在换冬毛，我可以从他的脖子上拔出一大撮松散的毛发，他现在看起来像个巨大的蒲公英。\n\n祝你在工作的头几周好运，Lamine。我知道这并不容易，但你绝对不是“不如别人”。按照自己的节奏前进——你做得很好。\n\n保重，\nDomino",

    "content": "Hi Domino ☺️\n\nYour letters really do feel like a comfort break too there's something grounding about hearing how other people navigate their weeks, especially when it involves both creative joy and adult responsibilities crashing into each other.\n\nThe furry gathering sounds amazing! Honestly, I'd love to be part of something like that. I thrive in那种热闹的氛围 (that kind of lively atmosphere) it genuinely feels like being in my element, you know? There's something about being surrounded by people just having fun and embracing their interests unapologetically. What was the party theme about? And I have to ask doesn't it get incredibly hot wearing those full suits? The photos you sent look absolutely chaotic in the best way, but I can't stop thinking about the heat situation hahaha.\n\nThe car maintenance reality check hits different though. 我也有类似的经历 (I have similar experiences), just in a completely different context. My money disappears taking care of my \"kids\" and no, I don't actually have children, but I have 7 team members who've somehow become my responsibility, and apparently I'm their collective parent now 😅 They call me \"Paman\" (Uncle) or sometimes say I act like a mom because I'm constantly looking after them. They're incredibly 撒娇 (manja/clingy), which is sweet but also expensive when you're still a student with no actual income hahahaha.\n\nJust last week, one of my girls couldn't use her old laptop anymore because it completely died too old, totally broken. She wanted to buy a new one but didn't have enough money, so naturally she came to me, and I ended up covering the difference. 我的钱包在哭泣 (My wallet is crying), but what can I do? They're my kids 😂\n\nI also spend a ridiculous amount on my friends' actual children their nephews and nieces who also call me Paman. Somehow I've become everyone's honorary uncle and my bank account suffers accordingly.\n\nYour car maintenance expenses sound seriously intense though. Stories like yours make me grateful I don't own a car yet. 我觉得我更适合坐公共交通 (I think I'm better suited for public transportation) or just bumming rides from friends hahaha. The freedom of a car sounds appealing, but the financial responsibility? 压力太大了 (Too much pressure).\n\nAbout the sushi victory feast it hasn't happened yet! Planning for this Friday or weekend, and honestly? I think I'm going solo. None of my friends are into sushi, so every time I eat it, I end up going alone anyway hahaha. But that's fine sometimes me-time over good food is exactly what you need after exam season, right?\n\nSpeaking of which some results are already out! I got A's in 4 subjects, just waiting on 3 more. 🙏 For the robot project, we've finished most of the work; now it's just fabrication and running my code to get everything operational. 快要完成了 (Almost done)!\n\nRandom update that you might appreciate: I just adopted a new master at my dorm hahaha. A cat, obviously. Haven't named him yet, but he's incredibly clingy with me specifically, which is adorable except for one terrible habit whenever I'm lying down, he walks over and puts his butt directly in my face 😂 我不知道这是爱还是侮辱 (I don't know if this is love or disrespect), but I guess that's just cat ownership in a nutshell.\n\nAnyway, 希望你这周工作顺利 (hope your week goes smoothly) and that the post-maintenance car runs like a dream. Sometimes expensive adulting does pay off in the long run, even if our wallets need time to recover.\n\nBest,  \nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino ☺️\n\n你的信真的像是一种心灵的慰藉，听到别人如何度过他们的一周，尤其是当创意的喜悦和成年人的责任交织在一起时，总有一种踏实的感觉。\n\n毛绒聚会听起来太棒了！老实说，我真的很想参与这样的活动。我在那种热闹的氛围中总是如鱼得水，你知道吗？被一群尽情享受、毫无保留地追求自己兴趣的人包围，真的有种归属感。聚会的主题是什么呢？还有，我必须问一下，穿那些全套服装不会特别热吗？你发的照片看起来确实很混乱，但这种混乱是好的，不过我一直在想那些人会不会热得受不了，哈哈。\n\n不过，说到汽车保养的现实，确实让人感到压力。我也有类似的经历，只是在完全不同的背景下。我的钱都花在照顾我的“孩子们”上了，不过我其实没有孩子，而是有7个团队成员，不知怎么的，他们成了我的责任，而我似乎成了他们的集体家长 😅 他们叫我“Paman”（叔叔），有时说我的行为像妈妈，因为我总是照顾他们。他们非常撒娇，这很可爱，但也很花钱，尤其是我还是个没有实际收入的学生，哈哈。\n\n就在上周，我的一个女孩的旧笔记本电脑彻底坏了，太老了，完全不能用了。她想买一台新的，但钱不够，所以很自然地来找我，结果我帮她补上了差额。我的钱包在哭泣，但有什么办法呢？他们是我的孩子 😂\n\n我还花了很多钱在朋友们的孩子身上，他们的侄子侄女也叫我Paman。不知怎么的，我成了大家的荣誉叔叔，我的银行账户也因此受到了影响。\n\n不过，你的汽车保养费用听起来确实很重。像你这样的故事让我庆幸自己还没有车。我觉得我更适合坐公共交通，或者干脆搭朋友的便车，哈哈。拥有一辆车的自由听起来很吸引人，但经济上的责任？压力太大了。\n\n关于寿司胜利宴，还没成行呢！计划这周五或周末，说实话，我可能要独自一人去了。我的朋友们都不喜欢寿司，所以每次吃寿司我都是一个人，哈哈。不过没关系，考试季过后，一个人享受美食的时间正是我所需要的，不是吗？\n\n顺便说一下，有些成绩已经出来了！我有4门课得了A，还有3门在等结果。🙏 对于机器人项目，我们已经完成了大部分工作，现在只需要制造和运行我的代码，让一切正常运作。快要完成了！\n\n还有一个你可能会喜欢的随机更新：我在宿舍刚刚收养了一位新主人，哈哈。当然是一只猫。还没给它起名字，但它特别黏我，这很可爱，除了一个糟糕的习惯——每当我躺下的时候，它就会走过来，把屁股直接对着我的脸 😂 我不知道这是爱还是侮辱，但我想这大概就是养猫的精髓吧。\n\n总之，希望你这周工作顺利，希望修完后的车能像梦一样顺畅。有时候，昂贵的成年人生活确实会在长期内带来回报，即使我们的钱包需要时间来恢复。\n\n最好的祝愿，  \nKel",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nYour letter reached me at just the right time — one of those evenings when everything feels a little heavier than usual, when you’re not exactly sad, but just… tired in a quiet way. Reading your words was like exhaling after holding my breath without realizing it. You have this steady, grounding tone when you write — it’s not dramatic or overly optimistic, just real. And sometimes, real is exactly what someone needs.\n\nWhat you said about layoffs being a “forced redirection” stayed with me. That’s such a calm and truthful way of putting it. I’ve been trying to see things that way too, but lately it’s been hard not to feel like I’m standing in a long pause that’s stretching further than I expected. Everything suddenly stopped, and I think I’m only now realizing how much of my sense of direction came from being in motion — working, planning, doing. When all of that went quiet, it left behind this stillness I wasn’t sure what to do with.\n\nYour story about your first job reminded me how unpredictable life can be. You didn’t try to romanticize it — you just said it how it was, unfair and sudden, but temporary. I admire that. It’s strange how we can be doing everything right, following the rhythm we think is “progress,” and yet life still hits pause on us without warning. I guess that’s what you meant by redirection — that sometimes being stopped is the only way we’re forced to look for another door.\n\nI’m preparing to start university soon, majoring in Business Administration. I tell people that and it sounds like a plan, but truthfully, I’m still figuring out what I want to make of it. I’m drawn to the idea of leadership and creativity, of building something that lasts, but there’s also this uncertainty that comes with new beginnings. Maybe that’s part of growing up — learning to walk even when the road isn’t completely clear.\n\nBefore this break, I was working remotely as a land cold caller. It was exhausting in its own way — constant targets, constant pressure, the kind of work that doesn’t leave much room to breathe. I learned a lot from it — patience, resilience, how to talk to people even when they didn’t want to talk back. But it also drained something in me. When it ended, I thought I’d immediately move on to the next thing, but instead, I found myself standing still, too tired to chase and too restless to rest.\n\nThat’s the space I’m in now — not falling apart, just… standing quietly at a crossroad, waiting for something inside me to align again. I try to fill my days with small things that make sense: reading, working out, writing my thoughts down just to understand them better. Some days it helps. Some days it doesn’t. But I think that’s okay. Not every day has to move the story forward.\n\nWhen you said you took a short gap and finally understood what “freedom” feels like — that hit deep. Because I think I’m in that same gap now, only mine feels heavier than I expected. Freedom sounds peaceful until you’re actually sitting in it — and then you realize it can be lonely, too. But maybe that’s the kind of loneliness that shapes you quietly, the kind that teaches you to be your own anchor.\n\nI can picture Nanjing cooling down — the air starting to turn crisp, the faint chill that lingers indoors longer than you’d like. You mentioned your cold keeps coming and going — maybe that’s your body’s way of whispering for rest, the kind that doesn’t just come from sleep but from slowing down mentally too. I hope you take it easy when you can, even if it’s just a quiet evening with tea and silence.\n\nYour words have this calm presence — not trying to fix things, just sitting beside them. I needed that more than I thought. It’s rare to talk to someone who understands the weight of pauses — not as something to escape, but something to live through.\n\nThank you for being that kind of person, Domino. For writing with the kind of honesty that doesn’t demand anything in return. I’ll keep writing too — even if slowly, even if some days it’s just a few quiet lines trying to make sense of all this in-between.\n\nTake care of yourself, and stay warm. I hope your next letter brings better weather — both outside and within.\n\nYour friend always,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n你的来信恰逢其时——在一个一切都显得比平时更沉重的夜晚，你既不感到悲伤，但又有些疲惫。读你的信就像在不知不觉中屏息后终于呼出一口气。你写信时那种稳重、踏实的语气——既不夸张也不过分乐观，只是真实。而有时候，真实正是一个人所需要的。\n\n你提到裁员是一种“被迫的重新定向”，这句话一直在我耳边回响。这是一种多么平静而真实的表达。我也试着从这个角度看待事情，但最近很难不觉得自己正处于一个比预期更长的暂停中。一切都突然停止了，我想我直到现在才意识到，我的方向感很大程度上来自于行动——工作、计划、做事。当这一切都安静下来时，留下的这种静止让我感到无所适从。\n\n你关于第一份工作的故事提醒了我，生活是多么不可预测。你没有试图美化它——只是如实描述，不公平、突然，但也是暂时的。我非常钦佩这一点。奇怪的是，我们可能做的一切都是正确的，遵循我们认为是“进步”的节奏，但生活仍然会在没有预警的情况下暂停。我想这就是你所说的重新定向——有时候，停下来是唯一迫使我们寻找另一扇门的方式。\n\n我即将开始大学生活，主修工商管理。我告诉别人时，听起来像是一个计划，但说实话，我还在努力弄清楚自己想从中得到什么。我被领导力和创造力的概念所吸引，想建立一些持久的东西，但新开始也伴随着不确定性。也许这就是成长的一部分——即使道路不完全清晰，也要学会前行。\n\n在这段休息之前，我一直在远程工作，做土地推销员。这是一份在某些方面令人疲惫的工作——不断的目标、不断的压力，这种工作几乎没有喘息的空间。我从中学到了很多——耐心、韧性、如何与人交流，即使他们不想回应。但这也耗尽了我内心的一部分。当这一切结束时，我以为自己会立即转向下一件事，但相反，我发现自己站在原地，太累了无法追逐，又太不安定无法休息。\n\n我现在就处于这样的状态——没有崩溃，只是……静静地站在十字路口，等待内心重新对齐。我试着用一些小事来充实自己的日子：阅读、锻炼、写下自己的想法以更好地理解它们。有些日子这会有帮助，有些日子则不会。但我想这没关系。不是每一天都必须推动故事向前发展。\n\n当你提到你短暂的休息期，终于理解了“自由”的感觉——这句话深深触动了我。因为我想我现在正处于同样的空档期，只是我的感觉比预期的更沉重。自由听起来很平静，直到你真正置身其中——然后你才会意识到它也可以是孤独的。但也许这种孤独会悄无声息地塑造你，教会你成为自己的锚点。\n\n我想象着南京正在逐渐凉爽——空气开始变得清新，室内那种淡淡的寒意比你希望的更久地停留。你提到你的感冒时好时坏——也许这是你的身体在低声呼唤休息，不仅仅是从睡眠中，而是从精神上放慢脚步。我希望你能在可以的时候放松一下，哪怕只是一个安静的夜晚，一杯茶和片刻的宁静。\n\n你的话语有一种平静的存在感——不是试图解决问题，而是陪伴在旁。我比自己想象的更需要这种陪伴。很少有人能理解暂停的重量——不是逃避，而是经历。\n\n谢谢你成为这样的人，Domino。感谢你用那种不求回报的诚实来写作。我也会继续写下去——即使慢慢来，即使有些日子只是几行安静的字句，试图理清这一切的中间状态。\n\n照顾好自己，保持温暖。希望你的下一封信带来更好的天气——无论是外界还是内心。\n\n永远的朋友，\nMoni",

I haven't seen your work, but you must be doing an excellent job, and you work very hard, so your work deserves good pay.\n\nYou know, I feel like it's become the same in the US. On Instagram, I see people dressing up as themselves or pop culture characters. It's nothing like the scary costumes anymore, haha. \n\nUm, otherwise, you know, I really want to get into creative work, like the poetry thing I told you about, so if you have any advice for me, don't hesitate!\n\nHaha 🤣, yes, it's time to get your winter clothes out!\n\nUnfortunately, the situation in Mali isn't improving, but I start work on Monday. And I found out this week that I don't have an office—in fact, they don't even know where they're going to put me, so I wonder why they hired me in the first place. I saw the employment contract of one of the meteorological engineers who was hired at the same time as me. The guy is the same age as me and his salary is huge. I felt like shit when I saw his salary. Anyway, I probably need to stop comparing myself to others. At least now I have a monthly salary.\n\nYoshi, big hug, take good care of yourself!\n\nÀ bientôt,\nLamine 🥀",

I went to a small furry gathering a friend hosted for his birthday, and I helped out as the photographer. It felt good to be behind the camera again, capturing those playful, chaotic moments — everyone in suits, dancing, joking around. You can probably imagine the kind of lively mess it turns into, but I love that energy.\n\nThen reality kicked back in: I spent nearly one-fifth of my monthly income at the 4S shop giving my car a full maintenance. 🥲 Keeping a big machine running smoothly is seriously no joke — time-consuming, wallet-draining, but still oddly satisfying when it’s done. I guess that’s adulthood: a mix of fun projects and expensive responsibilities.\n\nHow about you? Did your sushi victory feast finally happen, or are you still recovering from exams? 😄\n\nTake care,\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nI could really feel what you were describing in your last letter — that strange stillness that comes after everything suddenly stops. It’s never easy to deal with, but I think you’re handling it with a kind of calm most people don’t have.\n\nAbout layoffs — I understand that feeling all too well. My first official job after graduation ended the day before my three-month mark. The company was downsizing, and since I hadn’t passed my probation yet, I was the easiest one to let go — no compensation, just a list of terrible excuses from HR. There wasn’t much I could do, so I accepted it and moved on. A few weeks later, I found another job that I ended up staying in for more than two years (and left on my own terms). So I’ve come to believe that being laid off isn’t really a disaster — it’s just a forced redirection, and sometimes the next stop turns out to be much better.\n\nI was trying to picture your current situation — are you already graduated and working full-time, or are you still studying while working on the side? Or maybe preparing for university? I realize I don’t know much about how things work in Egypt. In China, students usually finish high school around 18 and then take the national university entrance exam, the gaokao. Their scores decide which university they can enter, which makes that year one of the most stressful parts of life.\n\nEarlier this year, I took a short gap myself — just a few months — and I think that was when I really understood what “freedom” feels like. Ever since then, I haven’t been able to fully settle back into an office rhythm again. So I mean it when I say that taking a break isn’t “falling behind.” As long as you know it’s rest, not retreat, you’re doing fine.\n\nAs for me, Nanjing’s weather has cooled down quite a bit. My cold keeps coming and going — I’m not sure if I never really got over it, or if I keep catching new ones. The office isn’t air-conditioned anymore, but the insulation is awful, so the chill just seeps in. Sometimes I wonder if the right fix is adding one more layer of clothing, or just… finding a way out of that office entirely.\n\nI really appreciate you writing so openly about everything. I hope your break gives you clarity and that when you start looking again, you’ll choose something that truly deserves your time. I’m here — and I’d like to keep hearing about what you discover next, take your pace.\n\nTake care of yourself, and give yourself credit for handling things as calmly as you do.\n\nYour friend always,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n我从你上一封信中描述的那种感觉中，真的体会到了一切突然停止后那种奇怪的静谧。这从来都不是一件容易应对的事，但我认为你处理得非常冷静，这是大多数人所不具备的。\n\n关于裁员——我对此感同身受。我毕业后的第一份正式工作，在我入职三个月前的那天就结束了。公司正在裁员，因为我还没有通过试用期，所以我是最容易被辞退的——没有补偿，只有人事部给出的一系列糟糕的借口。我无能为力，只能接受并继续前进。几周后，我找到了另一份工作，最终在那里待了两年多（而且是我主动离职的）。因此，我逐渐相信，被裁员并不是真正的灾难——它只是一种被迫的转向，有时下一个目的地会更好。\n\n我在想象你目前的情况——你是已经毕业并全职工作，还是在兼职的同时继续学习？或者是在准备上大学？我意识到我对埃及的情况了解不多。在中国，学生通常在18岁左右完成高中学业，然后参加全国大学入学考试，即高考。他们的成绩决定了可以进入哪所大学，这使得那一年成为生活中最紧张的部分之一。\n\n今年早些时候，我也给自己放了一个短假——只有几个月——那时我真正理解了“自由”是什么感觉。从那以后，我再也无法完全适应办公室的节奏了。所以，当我说休息并不是“落后”时，我是认真的。只要你明白这是休息，而不是退缩，你就做得很好。\n\n至于我，南京的天气已经凉爽了许多。我的感冒时好时坏——不确定是不是一直没有完全好，还是不断感染新的病毒。办公室不再开空调了，但保温效果很差，所以寒气总是渗进来。有时我在想，正确的解决办法是多加一件衣服，还是……干脆离开那个办公室。\n\n我非常感谢你如此坦诚地写下了这一切。希望你的休息能给你带来清晰的思考，当你再次寻找时，能选择真正值得你投入时间的事情。我在这里——希望继续听到你下一步的发现，按你自己的节奏来。\n\n照顾好自己，为自己处理事情时的冷静给予肯定。\n\n永远的朋友，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hi Domino☺️☺️\n\nHaha thanks for understanding the presentation tremors! Your speech contest background is seriously impressive though - competing in both English and Chinese as a kid must have built so much confidence. The fact that your spoken English is solid even if vocabulary is limited shows that you really internalized the language through performance. 靠语感硬撑 is honestly a valid strategy that works surprisingly well!\n\nI appreciate you sharing something so personal about the café-van project. That's a genuinely difficult existential question you're grappling with. When you build something with someone else's dream in mind, and then their path shifts naturally toward fulfillment elsewhere, it does make you wonder about the original purpose. But maybe the question isn't whether the project needs to exist in the same form - maybe it's whether you still need it for yourself, separate from him? If your boyfriend has found his rhythm at the hilltop café, perhaps your project could evolve into something that serves your own vision of freedom rather than being a platform for someone else's dream. \n\nYour definition of freedom as \"work that feels like breathing\" really resonates with me. Work shouldn't be suffocating or require constant effort just to endure. It should be natural, sustainable, something you can do without feeling like you're drowning.\n\nAbout the robot specs - yes, exactly! We're going with sensor fusion: IMU for orientation and acceleration data, GPS for outdoor positioning (though accuracy in campus is questionable), depth camera for obstacle detection and mapping, encoders for precise wheel odometry, and we're implementing an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) controller for adaptive decision-making. It's ambitious and honestly a bit overwhelming, but that's what makes it exciting, right? 感觉很nerd但这就是我喜欢的 (Feels very nerdy but that's what I love).\n\nThe 压力山大 meme explanation is perfect - I love how internet culture creates these linguistic hybrids that become so embedded people use them for over a decade. The visualization of pressure as a mountain is both dramatic and relatable, especially during exam season. 谢谢你的祝福 (Thanks for your wishes)!\n\nDeal on the sushi photo! Stay tuned for my victory unagi plate after midterms hehehe. I promise to document the conquest properly.\n\nAnd yes, that campus stray has completely stolen my heart. Honestly, I would be so happy if I could take care of her because then I wouldn't sleep alone anymore hahaha! Having a warm, purring companion waiting for you after exhausting days sounds like exactly the kind of comfort everyone needs.\n\n加油 to you too with your work and the café-van project contemplations. Sometimes the best clarity comes after we stop forcing answers and just let things breathe.\n\nBest,\nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨 Domino☺️☺️\n\n哈哈，谢谢理解我演讲时的紧张！你参加演讲比赛的背景真是令人印象深刻——小时候用英语和中文比赛肯定培养了很大的自信。即使词汇量有限，但你的口语依然很扎实，这说明你通过表演真正内化了语言。靠语感硬撑其实是一个非常有效的策略，效果出奇地好！\n\n感谢你分享关于咖啡车项目的个人感受。你面对的确实是一个非常难解的存在主义问题。当你为别人的梦想建造某样东西，而他们的道路自然地转向了其他地方时，这确实会让人质疑最初的初衷。但也许问题不在于项目是否需要以相同的形式存在——而是你是否仍然需要它，与他无关？如果你的男朋友已经在山顶咖啡馆找到了自己的节奏，也许你的项目可以演变成实现你自己的自由愿景的东西，而不仅仅是一个为别人梦想搭建的平台。\n\n你对自由的定义——“工作就像呼吸一样自然”——真的让我产生了共鸣。工作不应该让人窒息或需要不断努力才能忍受。它应该是自然的、可持续的，是你能做而不感到自己在溺水的事情。\n\n关于机器人的规格——没错！我们采用的是传感器融合：IMU用于姿态和加速度数据，GPS用于室外定位（虽然在校园内的精度存疑），深度相机用于障碍检测和地图构建，编码器用于精确的轮式里程计，我们还实现了ANN（人工神经网络）控制器以实现自适应决策。这既雄心勃勃又有点让人望而生畏，但正是这种挑战让人兴奋，对吧？感觉很nerd但这就是我喜欢的 (Feels very nerdy but that's what I love)。\n\n压力山大的表情包解释得太完美了——我爱互联网文化创造的这些语言混合体，它们如此深入人心，人们用了十多年。将压力比作山峰既戏剧化又让人感同身受，尤其是在考试季。谢谢你的祝福 (Thanks for your wishes)！\n\n说好的寿司照片！考试周后我会拍一张胜利的鳗鱼饭，嘿嘿嘿。我保证会好好记录这次征服。\n\n是的，那只校园流浪猫已经完全俘获了我的心。老实说，如果我能照顾她，我会非常开心，因为这样我就不会一个人睡觉了，哈哈哈！在疲惫的日子里，有一个温暖的、发出呼噜声的伙伴等着你，这正是每个人都需要的安慰。\n\n加油，希望你在工作和咖啡车项目思考中也能找到最好的答案。有时候，最好的清晰来自我们停止强迫答案，只是让事情自然发展。\n\n最好的祝愿，\nKel",

For what it’s worth, I’m a bit of a performance person myself; I did a lot of English/Chinese speech contests as a kid, so my spoken English is oddly okay… but my vocabulary is hilariously poor. 基本靠语感在硬撑，哈哈。\n\nThank you for the kind words about the island trip. 不多说了，你懂的。Let’s just say I made the most of it and moved on.\n\nSomething more personal I’ve been weighing: my studio/café-van plan started as a platform for my boyfriend (and maybe me) to do what he loves. That’s still my heart. But the project is in a holding pattern (design timelines, the coffee van months away), so I’m paying bills with work I don’t love, while he’s found a rhythm at a hilltop café and is steadily settling in. It leaves me wondering: if his dream is already taking root without this project, does mine still need to exist in the same form? 最近确实有点迷茫。Maybe freedom, for me, is finding a shape of work that feels like breathing.\n\nYour 4WD security patrol robot sounds legit. Now that I know what the big motor is for—what wheel diameter/gear ratio are you running, and what stall torque are you targeting? Battery pack chemistry and capacity? Brushed vs. BLDC with FOC? Are you starting with waypoint + PID, or going straight into sensor fusion later (IMU + encoders + maybe a depth cam/LiDAR)? 感觉再说下去有点太nerd了，先这样吧。\n\nYou asked about 压力山大. It’s a playful meme that stuck: people joked on the transliteration of “Alexander” (亚历山大) and fused it with “pressure as big as a mountain.” Very old internet—超过十年了—because it’s vivid and dramatic, perfect for exam week. 祝你这波压力小一点哈哈哈。\n\nI’ve duly noted your unagi-first policy. When you’re done with midterms, please claim your sushi reward and send me a photo of the first plate you conquer. Deal?\n\nAlso, that campus stray… 它真的太可爱了。If dorm rules loosen someday, I can already see you becoming a very soft cat dad.\n\n加油，最后冲刺。等你凯旋消息。\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n你的演讲故事让我笑得不行——最好的那种。“心里平静，手却在颤抖”真是绝了。说来也巧，我也是个有点表演欲的人；小时候参加过很多英语和中文的演讲比赛，所以我的口语还算可以……但词汇量简直搞笑。基本上靠语感硬撑，哈哈。\n\n感谢你对海岛之行的好评。不多说了，你懂的。就当我充分利用了这次机会，然后继续前行吧。\n\n最近我在思考一些更私人的事情：我的工作室/咖啡车计划最初是为了让我男朋友（也许还有我）做他喜欢的事情。这仍然是我的初衷。但项目现在处于停滞状态（设计时间线，咖啡车还要几个月），所以我现在做着我不喜欢的工作来支付账单，而他已经在山顶的一家咖啡馆找到了节奏，逐渐安定下来。这让我有些疑惑：如果他的梦想已经开始生根发芽，而不需要这个项目，我的梦想是否还需要以同样的形式存在？最近确实有点迷茫。也许对我而言，自由就是找到一种像呼吸一样自然的工作形式。\n\n你的四轮驱动安全巡逻机器人听起来很厉害。现在我知道大电机的用途了——你用的是多大的轮径和齿轮比？目标堵转扭矩是多少？电池组的化学成分和容量呢？是刷式电机还是带FOC的BLDC？你是从航点+PID开始，还是直接进入传感器融合（IMU+编码器+可能的深度相机/激光雷达）？感觉再说下去有点太nerd了，先这样吧。\n\n你问了“压力山大”。这是一个有趣的梗：人们把“Alexander”（亚历山大）的音译和“压力如山”结合在一起。非常老的网络梗——超过十年了——因为它生动而夸张，特别适合考试周。祝你这次压力小一点哈哈哈。\n\n我已经记住了你“先鳗鱼”的政策。等你考完期中考试，请务必领你的寿司奖励，并发一张你征服的第一盘寿司的照片给我。说定了？\n\n还有，那只校园流浪猫……它真的太可爱了。如果宿舍规则有一天放宽，我完全可以想象你成为一个非常温柔的猫爸。\n\n加油，最后冲刺。等你凯旋的消息。\n\n最好的祝福，\nDomino",

    "content": "Hi Lamine\n\nI totally agree with you — work is, in the end, for money. If I really chased money the way I should, I’d probably be earning a lot more right now. But my situation’s a bit awkward: most of the projects I’m involved in actually need me more than I need them, and I’m usually too lazy to negotiate. So I just end up half-heartedly helping out and accepting whatever modest payment comes with it.\n\nHalloween in China has turned into something quite different from the Western version. It’s more like a big meme convention — especially in theme parks or city centers. People dress up not as monsters or ghosts, but as funny internet memes or trending pop culture figures. It’s ridiculous and hilarious at the same time.\n\nI recovered from my cold for, let’s say, a few dozen hours… and now I think it’s coming back again 🥲.

I guess it’s time to dig my winter clothes out of the closet.\n\nI really hope the fuel situation in Mali improves soon, and that your first days at work go smoothly.

    "content": "Hi Domino! 😊\n\nFirst of all — no worries about the delay! Life gets busy, drafts disappear (RIP to that half-written letter 🥲), and sometimes we accidentally sleep until noon. It happens! I actually need to apologize too — 对不起！I've been so caught up with exams lately that I'm only now getting to reply. But my exams will finally be over next Tuesday, so I'm almost free! 🎉\n\nI have to share something funny that happened last night though! I had an English presentation exam in front of the class — no script, no PowerPoint, just explaining to the auditor. The thing is, I'm someone who tremors easily when nervous. So before my turn, I went to the toilet to do some stretching exercises to calm myself down, and it actually worked! I felt much calmer. Here's the weird part: I wasn't even panicking or anxious mentally — my brain and heart were completely fine — but my hands were still shaking! 😅 When it was my turn to present, my hands were tremoring so badly that suddenly the whole class just burst out laughing! 太尴尬了 (so embarrassing) but also kind of funny? My mind and body were just... not on the same page hahaha. Anyway, I survived!\n\nNow, about your letter — I'm so sorry to hear that your island trip turned into a solo journey. 真的很遗憾 (that's really unfortunate). A typhoon passing through AND your boyfriend not being able to join because of complicated circumstances... that must have been such a bittersweet experience. I can only imagine how much you were looking forward to that two-person getaway. 💙 But you know what? The fact that you still went, despite everything, shows so much strength. Not everyone can turn disappointment into a solo adventure like that.\n\nAnd those beach photos you sent? 太美了！(So beautiful!) The island looks absolutely stunning. There's something about coastal landscapes that just... speaks to the soul, you know? I completely relate to what you said about standing barefoot on the sand with the sea breeze brushing against you — it really does feel like a reset. 我也很喜欢海风 (I also love the sea breeze). There's this sense of peace and clarity that comes from being near the ocean. I hope you do get to go back someday, maybe under happier circumstances. ❤️\n\nAbout the jewelry project — I can really feel your conflict. Your partner wants you to invest more, but you're craving freedom again. 我理解你的感受 (I understand how you feel). Before you make any decision, I'd just say this: think about all the aspects carefully. Consider not just what feels right now, but also what might impact your future — financially, emotionally, career-wise. Sometimes the thing we want to drop is actually worth keeping, and sometimes the thing holding us back really does need to be let go. 加油，Domino! Whatever you choose, I support you. Just make sure it's a decision you won't regret later, okay? You deserve to spend your time and energy on something that truly lights you up. 🔥\n\nNow, about seafood — 我们真的很像！(We're really alike!) I'm EXACTLY the same with crab and shrimp! 😂 They're delicious, but peeling them is so much work and honestly kind of frustrating. I never do it myself either — my friends always end up doing it for me hahaha. I've tried learning how to peel them properly, but 太难了 (it's too hard)! So I've just... given up. No shame in that, right? I'm totally with you on this one. I much prefer seafood that's already ready to eat!\n\nAnd yes, I love steamed cod and salmon sashimi too! 真的很好吃 (really delicious)! Hamasushi sounds amazing — seared foie gras and salmon sushi? 😭 Now I'm even more excited for my sushi reward after exams! Speaking of which, you asked if I've had it yet — not yet! My exams end next Tuesday, so I still have a few more days of suffering before I can finally indulge. 我真的等不及了 (I really can't wait)!\n\nAbout the salty milk tea from Inner Mongolia — 我很好奇！(I'm very curious!) I've never tried it before, but now I really want to. The traditional version with just salt sounds... unusual but intriguing? And the improved version with a hint of sweetness and saltiness to bring out the flavor sounds perfect. Your memory of walking outside in -10°C weather holding a steaming cup of salty milk tea — 听起来很浪漫 (that sounds so romantic) and cozy at the same time. 真美好 (truly beautiful). I hope I get to try it someday when I visit China! 💙\n\nAbout 压力山大 (ya li shan da) — I actually don't know the full origin story! I've heard people use it before and I know it means \"pressure as big as a mountain,\" but I don't know how it was coined. 你能告诉我吗？(Can you tell me?) I'd love to learn the story behind it!\n\nOh, and about that kitten photo — 😂 that's not my cat! It's actually a stray cat on my campus. One day it just came up to me, and now it keeps coming to my room! 太可爱了 (so adorable)! It's so cute and fluffy that I literally want to bite it hahaha. 我真的很喜欢它 (I really like it). I wish I could keep it, but I can't have pets in my dorm. Your 呆比 sounds so sweet though! I'm sorry you accidentally stepped on his toy ball 🥲, but I'm glad the new toy made up for it. Cats are surprisingly forgiving, aren't they?\n\nAnd yes — that big motor in the picture is part of my project! 你猜对了 (you guessed right)! It's for a 4WD security patrol robot that's going to be implemented in a company. It's one of my Electrical Engineering projects, and honestly, it's been both challenging and exciting. 很有趣！(Very interesting!)\n\nFinally — thank you SO much for offering to be my guide in China. 我真的很感激！(I'm really grateful!) Knowing I'll have a friend like you there makes the dream feel so much more real. I can't wait to explore with you, try all the amazing food, and maybe even do one of those spontaneous road trips you love so much. 我一定会去的！(I will definitely go!) When that day comes, you'll be the first person I contact. 💙\n\nFor now, I need to survive these last few exams. 再坚持一下！(Just hold on a little longer!) I'll update you after my sushi reward mission! 🍣\n\n祝你一切顺利 (wishing you all the best), and thank you for always being so supportive and inspiring. 我很幸运认识你 (I'm very lucky to know you)!\n\nBest,  \nKel 💙",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino！😊\n\n首先——别担心延迟的事！生活总是忙忙碌碌的，草稿也会消失（那封只写了一半的信，RIP 🥲），有时候我们还会不小心睡到中午。这都是常有的事！其实我也需要向你道歉——对不起！最近我一直在忙考试，所以现在才回复你。不过我的考试终于在下周二就结束了，所以我快自由了！🎉\n\n不过，我得和你分享昨晚发生的一件趣事！我在班上有一个英语演讲考试——没有稿子，没有PPT，就是对着听众讲解。问题是，我是一个很容易紧张到发抖的人。所以在轮到我之前，我去了厕所做了一些拉伸运动来让自己冷静下来，结果真的有效！我感觉平静多了。奇怪的是，我心理上并没有感到紧张或焦虑——我的大脑和心脏都很正常——但我的手还是在抖！😅 当轮到我演讲时，我的手抖得那么厉害，结果全班同学都突然大笑起来！太尴尬了（真尴尬），但也挺搞笑的？我的大脑和身体就是……不在一个频道上，哈哈哈哈哈。不过，我还是挺过来了！\n\n现在说说你的信——听到你的海岛之旅变成了独自旅行，我真的很遗憾。真的太不幸了。台风来袭，再加上你的男朋友因为复杂的情况不能同行……这一定是一段苦乐参半的经历。我只能想象你有多么期待这次两个人的旅行。💙 但是你知道吗？尽管遇到了这么多困难，你还是决定去了，这显示了你巨大的勇气。不是每个人都能把失望变成一次独自的冒险。\n\n还有你发来的那些海滩照片？太美了！（So beautiful!）那个岛看起来美极了。海岸线的风景总是……触动心灵，不是吗？我完全能理解你所说的赤脚站在沙滩上，海风拂面的感觉——真的就像是一种重启。我也很喜欢海风。在海边总能感受到一种平静和清晰。希望你有一天能再回去，也许是在更愉快的环境下。❤️\n\n关于首饰项目——我能感受到你的矛盾。你的伴侣希望你投入更多，但你又渴望自由。我理解你的感受。在做决定之前，我想说的是：仔细考虑所有的方面。不仅要考虑现在的感觉，还要考虑未来的影响——经济上、情感上、职业上。有时候，我们想放弃的东西其实是值得保留的，而有时候，阻碍我们的东西真的需要放手。加油，Domino！无论你选择什么，我都支持你。只要确保你不会后悔，好吗？你值得把时间和精力花在真正让你充满热情的事情上。🔥\n\n说到海鲜——我们真的很像！（We're really alike!）我也是完全一样的感觉！蟹和虾确实很好吃，但剥壳实在是太麻烦了，而且说实话，还挺让人沮丧的。我从不自己剥壳——总是朋友们帮我剥，哈哈哈哈哈。我试过学习如何正确剥壳，但太难了！所以我……放弃了。这也没什么丢脸的，对吧？在这个问题上，我完全和你站在一边。我更喜欢那些已经剥好壳的海鲜！\n\n还有，我也喜欢清蒸鳕鱼和三文鱼刺身！真的很好吃！（really delicious!）Hamasushi听起来太棒了——炙烤鹅肝和三文鱼寿司？😭 现在我更期待考试结束后的寿司奖励了！说到这个，你问过我有没有吃过了——还没有！我的考试要到下周二才结束，所以还得再忍受几天，然后才能尽情享受。我真的等不及了！（I really can't wait）！\n\n关于内蒙古的咸奶茶——我很好奇！（I'm very curious!）我以前从未尝试过，但现在真的想试试。传统的咸奶茶听起来……有点特别，但也很吸引人？改良版的咸甜结合听起来完美。你提到在零下10度的天气里，手里拿着一杯热腾腾的咸奶茶——听起来既浪漫又温馨。真美好。希望有一天去中国时能尝一尝！💙\n\n关于“压力山大”——我其实不知道它的完整来历！我听人用过这个词，知道它意味着“压力如山”，但不知道它是怎么来的。你能告诉我吗？（Can you tell me?）我很想了解这个词背后的故事！\n\n哦，还有那只小猫的照片——😂 那不是我的猫！其实是我校园里的一只流浪猫。有一天它突然走到我面前，现在它总是来我的房间！太可爱了（so adorable）！它那么可爱，那么毛茸茸，我简直想咬一口，哈哈哈哈哈。我真的很喜欢它。真希望我能收养它，但宿舍不允许养宠物。不过你的呆比听起来也很可爱！虽然你不小心踩到了它的玩具球 🥲，但新的玩具弥补了这一切。猫真的很宽容，不是吗？\n\n还有——照片里的那个大电机——你猜对了！（you guessed right!）那是我项目的一部分，是一个四轮驱动的安全巡逻机器人，将被应用到一家公司。这是我电气工程的一个项目，说实话，既具有挑战性，又非常有趣。很有趣！（Very interesting!）\n\n最后——非常感谢你愿意在中国做我的向导。我真的很感激！知道有你这样的朋友在那里，让这个梦想变得更加真实。我迫不及待想和你一起探索，尝试所有美味的食物，也许还能来一次你最喜欢的即兴公路旅行。我一定会去的！（I will definitely go!）到那时，你将是第一个我联系的人。💙\n\n现在，我需要撑过最后几场考试。再坚持一下！（Just hold on a little longer!）我会在享受完寿司奖励后更新你！🍣\n\n祝你一切顺利（wishing you all the best），感谢你一直以来的支持和鼓励。我很幸运认识你！（I'm very lucky to know you）！\n\n最好的祝福，  \nKel 💙",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nSorry it took me so long to reply — things have been a little heavy lately. I actually lost my job not too long ago. It wasn’t because I did anything wrong, but more of a restructuring thing, or at least that’s what they said. It still hit me harder than I expected. I had gotten used to my daily routine — the calls, the people, even the little annoyances that came with it — so when it all suddenly stopped, I felt this strange emptiness. The first few days were rough; I was just sitting around, not really knowing what to do with all the sudden free time.\n\nBut after a while, I started taking it as a forced break — a moment to reset, think things through, and slow down. I booked a doctor’s appointment too because I had been feeling really drained physically before that, and it turned out it was just overexhaustion. So I decided to take things easier for a bit — catching up on some shows, games, and sleep. But honestly, I’m starting to get bored now, so next week I’ll probably start job hunting again or maybe dive back into a new routine. Sometimes life has its odd ways of pushing us toward better paths, even when it doesn’t feel like it at first.\n\nI’m really glad to hear your cold didn’t last long! That phrase you used — “力大砖飞” — made me laugh. It fits you perfectly; I could totally imagine you tackling everything with that same level of energy, even when it’s just taking medicine. Poor Debbie though! I hope he’s feeling better now too. And speaking of him — those photos you sent honestly made my day. Debbie looks so cute in those costumes; it gave me such a good smile. I really needed that, to be honest. He has this charm that just brightens up the mood instantly.\n\nYou should definitely try silk bedding when summer comes around. It’s not an exaggeration — it’s that good. It feels cool when the weather’s hot, and somehow warm and soft when it’s colder. I actually prefer it over the satin bonnet now. It makes going to bed feel like a little luxury at the end of the day.\n\nThank you again for your words about work. I can’t tell you how much they meant to me. Sometimes, I feel like I’m just trying to stay afloat and keep things together, but hearing you say that gave me some reassurance that I’m on the right path — that it’s okay to take a step back and trust that things will align again. You’ve got this calm, thoughtful way of expressing things that really sticks with me.\n\nYou’re the most genuine and consistent friend I have on this app, Domino — and I don’t say that lightly. I always look forward to your letters; they bring a bit of warmth and familiarity that’s hard to find here.\n\nTake care of yourself, keep warm, and give Debbie a few pats from me. He’s truly a little star.\n\nWarm regards,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n抱歉这么久才回复你——最近事情有点沉重。其实，我不久前失业了。并不是因为我做错了什么，而是所谓的“重组”，至少他们是这么说的。尽管如此，这件事还是比我预期的要打击更大。我已经习惯了每天的例行公事——电话、同事，甚至是那些小烦恼——所以当这一切突然停止时，我感到一种奇怪的空虚。最初几天很难熬，我只是坐在那里，不知道如何打发突然多出来的空闲时间。\n\n但过了一段时间，我开始把它当作一种被迫的休息——一个重新调整、思考问题和放慢脚步的时刻。我还预约了医生，因为之前我感觉身体非常疲惫，结果发现只是过度劳累。所以我决定暂时放松一下——追追剧、玩游戏、多睡一会儿。但说实话，我现在开始感到无聊了，所以下周我可能会重新开始找工作，或者重新投入新的日常。有时候，生活会以奇怪的方式推动我们走向更好的道路，即使一开始感觉并不如此。\n\n很高兴听到你的感冒没有持续太久！你用的那个词——“力大砖飞”——让我笑了。这个词太适合你了；我完全可以想象你即使在吃药时也充满同样的活力。可怜的Debbie！希望他现在感觉好些了。说到他——你发来的照片真的让我很开心。Debbie穿上那些服装的样子太可爱了，让我笑得很开心。说实话，我真的很需要这样的笑容。他有一种魅力，能瞬间提升人的心情。\n\n夏天来临时，你一定要试试丝绸床品。这绝不是夸张——它真的很好。天气热时它感觉凉爽，天气冷时又温暖柔软。我甚至更喜欢它胜过丝绸发帽。它让每天晚上睡觉都变成了一种小小的奢侈。\n\n再次感谢你关于工作的那些话。你不知道它们对我有多重要。有时候，我感觉自己只是在努力维持，保持一切正常，但听到你说的话给了我一些安慰，让我相信自己走在正确的道路上——偶尔退一步，相信事情会重新对齐。你有一种平静而深思熟虑的表达方式，让我印象深刻。\n\nDomino，你是我在这款应用上最真诚、最可靠的朋友——我这么说绝不是轻率的。我总是期待着你的来信；它们带来了一种难以在这里找到的温暖和熟悉感。\n\n照顾好自己，注意保暖，替我给Debbie几下抚摸。他真是个小明星。\n\n温暖的问候，\nMoni",

I have a tendency to go overboard with things sometimes; I think the phrase “力大砖飞” (meaning, if you have enough strength, you can make a brick fly) fits me perfectly. It’s a little funny but also kinda accurate to how I tend to approach situations 🤣. Either way, I’m feeling completely fine now, though I think I may have passed the cold on to my partner… well, guess this is the time of year when everyone gets hit by something.\n\nAs for the silk bedding, that sounds like a dream! I can already imagine how soft and smooth it must be. Maybe I’ll give it a try next summer — right now, Nanjing is already pretty chilly, and I’ve swapped my bedding for something thicker to stay warm.\n\nAbout the work situation, I hear you — it’s hard to escape the same routine, especially when it feels uninteresting. But I admire your attitude. You’re not letting yourself settle into it, and that’s the kind of mindset that keeps things from becoming too stale. If the right opportunity comes, I’m sure you’ll know exactly how to jump at it. You’ve got the drive for it.\n\nI was surprised to hear about Halloween in Egypt! It’s not widely celebrated in China either, but I’ve seen it more in larger cities, mostly in expat communities or among younger people who like to dress up. I used to get some costumes for Debbie from my friends — I’ll have to check and see if I can find any photos of him in his old outfits. If I do, I’ll be sure to send them your way.\n\nTake care of yourself, Moni, and thank you for always being there. I’m really looking forward to hearing from you again soon.\n\nWarmly,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Moni，\n\n非常感谢你关心我。我的感冒并不严重——第一天我可能用药过量了，但之后我很快就恢复了。我有时候确实有点过度投入，我觉得“力大砖飞”（意思是如果你有足够的力量，可以让砖头飞起来）这句话用在我身上再合适不过了。这既好笑又准确地描述了我处理事情的方式🤣。不管怎样，我现在感觉完全好了，不过我可能把感冒传给了我的伴侣……看来这确实是一年中大家容易生病的时候。\n\n至于丝绸床品，听起来真像一场梦！我都能想象它有多柔软光滑。或许我明年夏天会尝试一下——现在南京已经相当冷了，我已经换上了更厚的床品来保暖。\n\n关于工作情况，我理解你的感受——很难摆脱一成不变的日常，尤其是当它显得乏味时。但我非常钦佩你的态度。你没有让自己安于现状，这种心态可以防止事情变得过于陈旧。如果合适的机会出现，我相信你会知道如何抓住它。你有这个动力。\n\n听到你在埃及庆祝万圣节，我感到很惊讶！在中国，万圣节也不太流行，但在大城市里，尤其是在外籍社区或喜欢打扮的年轻人中，还是能看到一些庆祝活动。我以前从朋友那里给Debbie弄过一些万圣节的服装——我会找找看，如果能找到他穿旧服装的照片，一定会发给你。\n\n照顾好自己，Moni，感谢你一直以来的支持。我非常期待再次收到你的来信。\n\n温暖地，\nDomino",

    "content": "Hi Domino 🤗,\nHow are you? I'm really sorry, but I've been really busy lately. I had to do some errands for work (opening a bank account and other administrative stuff), and on top of that, there's a huge gas shortage in Mali right now, so it's hard to get around.\n\nYes, I hope horse riding will bring me some peace of mind.\nOh, I hope you've been able to rest. If it gets too much, maybe you should let go of some projects that aren't very important. Don't overwork yourself!\nYou know what I like about my new job? It's not complicated or competitive. I'll just be responsible for distributing mail and documents. It's not very stressful.\n\nOh my god, it's really beautiful 😍 and the story of the leader and his wife is so romantic 🥹.\nUnfortunately, in Mali there is no fall, there are only two main seasons here: the dry season and the rainy season. But around November-February it gets cold.\nI would love to see the other seasons one day, they look so beautiful.\n\nAh, Debbie is a boy 😅. No, Debbie isn't idiot, he's very intelligent and he's royalty, haha.\n\nThank you very much, Domino. I hope you've slowed down your work pace a little. Have a nice time.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nLamine 🥀",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino 🤗，\n你好吗？真的很抱歉，最近我非常忙。工作上有些事情需要处理（比如开设银行账户和其他一些行政事务），再加上马里现在正面临严重的汽油短缺，出行变得非常困难。\n\n是的，我希望骑马能给我带来一些内心的平静。\n哦，希望你能够好好休息。如果压力太大，也许可以放弃一些不那么重要的项目。不要让自己太劳累！\n你知道吗，我喜欢我的新工作的一点是，它既不复杂也不竞争激烈。我只是负责分发邮件和文件，压力不大。\n\n天啊，真的太美了😍，而且领袖和他的妻子的故事真是浪漫至极🤤。\n可惜的是，马里没有秋天，这里只有两个主要的季节：旱季和雨季。不过到了11月到2月，天气会变冷。\n我真希望能有一天看到其他季节，它们看起来非常美丽。\n\n啊，Debbie 是个男孩 😅。不，Debbie 并不傻，他非常聪明，而且是贵族，哈哈。\n\n非常感谢你，Domino。希望你的工作节奏能稍微慢一些。祝你一切顺利。\n\n期待下次联系，\nLamine 🥀",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nI completely understand what you mean about the bonnet — it can definitely feel a bit strange at first. Since you usually shower before bed, it makes sense why it wouldn’t fit easily into your routine. But if you ever want a similar benefit without wearing something on your head, you could try using a satin or silk pillowcase instead. It feels amazing to sleep on — cool in the summer and warm, soft, and cozy in colder weather. Honestly, I prefer it even more than the satin bonnet; it’s one of those small upgrades that just make your nights more comfortable. I think you’d really like it.\n\nReading your thoughts about work really struck me. I can relate to what you said about being appreciated for the wrong reasons — it’s painful when people value effort but not depth, when sincerity is seen as naivety instead of strength. I admire how you stay true to yourself even in environments where manipulation or hidden meanings seem to be the norm. That’s rare, and honestly, it’s something I deeply respect about you.\n\nMy cousins’ school will actually be having a Halloween party this Friday. I’ve gone once or twice in the past few years — it used to be such a fun event. They’d go all out with the decorations: fake cobwebs on the walls, orange lights glowing faintly in the corners, kids running around in every kind of costume you could imagine — tiny vampires, witches, superheroes, and ghosts, all laughing and taking pictures. The atmosphere used to feel so alive; even the music playing in the background had that playful spooky charm to it. But lately, they’ve cut part of the funding for those events, so it feels more like a simple get-together now rather than a full celebration. It’s honestly become a bit lamer, so I’ll probably skip it this year — I think my cousins will too. Still, if they end up going, I’ll make sure to send you a few photos.\n\nAnd I really meant what I said before — you’re the most genuine and consistent friend I have on this app. Most people come and go, but your sincerity and warmth always shine through every letter. It’s comforting to have someone who not only writes beautifully but means every word. That kind of honesty and steady connection is something I truly appreciate.\n\nI’m sorry to hear you caught a cold — I hope by the time you’re reading this, you’re feeling much better. Please rest well, drink something warm, and don’t push yourself too hard. You deserve some peace after everything you’ve been managing.\n\nTake care of yourself, and I’m really looking forward to hearing from you again soon.\n\nWarm regards,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n我完全理解你对头巾的感受——刚开始确实会有些不习惯。因为你通常在睡前洗澡，所以它不太容易融入你的日常。但如果你想获得类似的好处而不必戴在头上，可以试试用丝绸或缎面枕套。睡在上面的感觉非常美妙——夏天凉爽，冬天温暖、柔软、舒适。老实说，我甚至更喜欢它，胜过缎面头巾；这小小的升级确实让夜晚更加舒适。我觉得你会喜欢的。\n\n读到你对工作的想法，我深有感触。我能理解你说的被误解的痛苦——当人们只看重努力而忽视深度，当真诚被视为天真而非力量时，这种感觉确实很难受。我非常钦佩你即使在充满操纵和隐晦含义的环境中，也能保持真实的自我。这是非常难得的，也是我非常尊敬你的一点。\n\n我表弟的学校这周五将举办万圣节派对。过去几年我参加过一两次，那确实是一个非常有趣的活动。他们会全力以赴布置：墙上挂着假蜘蛛网，角落里散发着微弱的橙色灯光，孩子们穿着各种你能想象到的服装跑来跑去——小吸血鬼、女巫、超级英雄和幽灵，都在欢笑和拍照。那时的气氛非常活跃，就连背景音乐也充满了那种有趣的恐怖魅力。但最近，他们削减了这些活动的部分资金，所以现在感觉更像是一个简单的聚会，而不是完整的庆祝活动。确实有点儿乏味，所以我今年可能不会去了——我想我表弟也不会去。不过，如果他们最终还是去了，我会确保给你发几张照片。\n\n我之前说的话是真心的——你是我在这款应用上最真诚、最稳定的朋友。大多数人来来去去，但你的真诚和温暖总是在每封信中闪耀。有一个人不仅写得美，而且字字真诚，这让我感到很安慰。这种诚实和稳定的联系是我非常珍视的。\n\n听说你感冒了，我感到很遗憾——希望你读到这封信时已经感觉好多了。请好好休息，喝点热饮，不要逼自己太紧。你值得在经历了一切之后得到一些平静。\n\n保重身体，我真的很期待不久后再次收到你的来信。\n\n温暖的问候，\nMoni",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nThe idea of the satin bonnet is a good one, but I’m not sure if I could get used to the feeling of my hair being confined while I sleep. Also, I’m someone who’s used to showering before bed, so sometimes my hair isn’t completely dry by the time I’m ready to sleep. I usually let it air dry a bit before going to bed, and if I wear a bonnet, I feel like it might get a little too complicated for my routine.\n\nI’m really glad you can empathize with my thoughts on work. When I first graduated, I actually found this “workhorse” mentality useful. I used to be proud of saying, “My work efficiency is literally ten times that of others.” But over time, I realized my bosses didn’t appreciate me for my abilities — they valued me for my “naive clarity” and my high cost-to-value ratio. 😡 I’m not the most sensitive when it comes to “the art of language,” and I find it hard to understand hidden meanings in what people say — and I don’t really like it either. While I’ve been forced to learn a lot of survival skills to deal with people who aren’t straightforward, I still resist that style of communication. It’s like one of my partners once said — between friends, simplicity and sincerity work, but when dealing with someone who doesn’t play fair, sticking to a moral baseline can end up putting us at a disadvantage. I still don’t fully agree with that theory, but I wonder if I’ll feel differently once I’m the sole person responsible for my own project in the future. 🤔\n\nI’m really glad to hear that you consider me one of the true friends you’ve met slowly along the way. I feel the same. There’s a certain threshold in letter exchanges, and some friendships disappearing is almost inevitable. But when the quantity of letters exchanged reaches a certain point, that’s when a qualitative shift happens. Regardless, I’m truly happy to have met you and to have these deeper conversations with you.\n\nToday, I don’t know why, but I came down with a pretty bad cold (maybe I kicked off the blanket last night). I’ve been feeling weak all day and struggling to concentrate. I took some over-the-counter medicine and hope to recover quickly.\n\nTake care of yourself too. Looking forward to hearing from you again.\n\nBest regards,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n关于丝绸睡帽的想法确实不错，但我不确定自己能否习惯在睡觉时头发被束缚的感觉。另外，我习惯在睡前洗澡，所以有时候头发到睡觉时还没有完全干。我通常会让它自然晾干一会儿再睡觉，如果戴睡帽，感觉会让我现有的睡前程序变得有些复杂。\n\n我很高兴你能理解我对工作的看法。刚毕业时，我确实觉得这种“工作狂”心态很有用。我曾经为能说“我的工作效率是别人的十倍”而感到自豪。但随着时间的推移，我意识到老板们并不是因为我的能力而欣赏我，而是因为我“单纯的清晰”和高性价比。 😡 我在“语言的艺术”方面并不敏感，很难理解别人话中的隐含意义，而且我也不喜欢这种感觉。虽然为了应对那些不直来直去的人，我被迫学到了很多生存技巧，但我仍然抵制这种交流方式。就像我以前的一个合伙人说的——朋友之间，简单和真诚是有效的，但面对不公正的人时，坚持道德底线可能会让我们处于不利。我目前还不完全同意这种观点，但不知道将来自己独自负责项目时，会不会有不一样的看法。🤔\n\n很高兴听到你认为我是你慢慢结识的真正朋友之一。我也有同感。书信往来中确实有一个门槛，有些友谊的消失几乎是不可避免的。但当书信的数量达到一定量时，就会发生质的变化。无论如何，我真的很高兴能遇到你，能和你进行这些深入的交流。\n\n今天不知为什么，我得了重感冒（可能是昨晚踢被子了）。一整天都感觉浑身无力，难以集中注意力。我吃了一些非处方药，希望尽快恢复。\n\n你也多保重。期待再次收到你的来信。\n\n此致，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hi Kel,\n\nFirst of all, sorry for the delay! I actually started writing this letter a few days ago, but then got caught up with work and totally forgot to finish it. And today… I accidentally slept until noon, woke up, and realized the half-written draft had disappeared. 🥲 So I told myself — no matter what — I have to finish and send it before I go to bed tonight.\n\nSometimes, revisiting the past really does make you happy. I still miss those carefree days of road-tripping from last year. Just the other day, I met with one of my partners from the jewelry project — she wants me to invest more time and energy into it. But honestly, I’m craving freedom again. 😪 I have a feeling that before the year ends, I might just drop all these projects and find a way to focus on something I actually want to spend my time and energy on.\n\nAbout seafood — what I really love is that fresh ocean flavor. And like you, I’m not a fan of anything with shells. Shrimp is already a bit too much work for me, and crabs… they actually freak me out a little. 😅 The only time I eat crab is when my boyfriend patiently picks the meat out for me. My absolute favorites are cod and salmon — steamed cod tastes incredibly delicate, and salmon sashimi is pure bliss.\n\nCoincidentally, today is my roommate’s birthday, so we went out for dinner at Hamasushi. I finally got to eat my beloved seared foie gras and salmon sushi again. 😋\n\nAbout milk tea — the most traditional Inner Mongolian milk tea only adds salt to the milk base, which can be a bit unusual for people who aren’t used to it. But I quite like it. The version I mentioned before, though, was from a local milk tea chain in Inner Mongolia. They had improved it a bit — adding a slight sweetness with just a hint of saltiness to bring out the flavor. It was so good. I still remember that winter: walking outside in -10°C weather, holding a steaming cup of that salty milk tea — pure happiness.\n\nBy the time you read this, your exams should be over, right? I hope everything went well — and that a well-deserved sushi feast is waiting for you! 🍣 I was honestly surprised that you know the phrase 压力山大 (ya li shan da)! That’s such a funny one — do you know how it was coined?\n\nYour travel stories sound pretty great too! I don’t remember if I’ve mentioned this before, but I really love the sea. So coastal trips are always right up my alley. Last month, I took a solo road trip to an island along China’s southeastern coast — roughly across from Taiwan. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a perfect trip. A typhoon was passing through during those days, and what was originally supposed to be a two-person getaway (with my boyfriend) turned into a solo journey because of some complicated circumstances.\n\nStill, I took some photos there — I’ll attach a few below. I’m not sure if I’ll ever go back, but I’d really love to. There’s something about standing barefoot on the sand, with the wind from the sea brushing against you, that feels like it resets the soul.\n\nI can really feel your passion for visiting China — 加油! Don’t stress about it too much. Whenever you do get the chance, please let me be your guide here. I’ll make sure you eat way too well. 😄\n\nThe pic of the kitten looks absolutely adorable — I wish my 呆比  were that clingy! I accidentally stepped on one of his toy balls the other day and broke it 🥲, so I got him a new toy as compensation. Thankfully, he seems pretty satisfied with my peace offering.\n\nAnd that big motor in your picture — is it part of your project? I’m curious, what kind of machinery uses a motor that size?\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n首先，抱歉回复晚了！其实我几天前就开始写这封信了，但后来被工作缠住了，完全忘了继续写。今天……我居然睡到了中午，醒来后发现半写好的草稿不见了。🥲 所以我告诉自己——无论如何，今晚睡觉前一定要写完并发出去。\n\n有时候，重温过去真的会让人感到快乐。我仍然怀念去年那些无忧无虑的自驾游日子。前几天，我见到了珠宝项目的合作伙伴之一——她希望我能投入更多的时间和精力。但老实说，我现在渴望自由。😪 我有种预感，年底前我可能会放下所有这些项目，找点真正想投入时间和精力的事情来做。\n\n关于海鲜——我最喜欢的是那种新鲜的海洋风味。和你一样，我不喜欢带壳的海鲜。虾对我来说已经有点麻烦了，至于螃蟹……它们其实有点吓到我了。😅 我唯一吃螃蟹的时候，是男朋友耐心地帮我挑出肉来。我最喜欢的还是鳕鱼和三文鱼——清蒸鳕鱼的味道非常细腻，而三文鱼刺身则是纯粹的享受。\n\n巧的是，今天是我室友的生日，所以我们去Hamasushi吃了晚饭。我终于又吃到了心爱的炙烤鹅肝和三文鱼寿司。😋\n\n关于奶茶——最传统的内蒙古奶茶只在奶基中加盐，这可能对不习惯的人来说有点奇怪。但我挺喜欢的。不过我之前提到的那种，是内蒙古当地一家奶茶连锁店的改良版——加了一点甜味，带点咸味，味道非常棒。我还记得那个冬天：在零下10度的天气里，走在外面，手里拿着一杯热腾腾的咸奶茶——纯粹的幸福。\n\n等你看到这封信时，考试应该已经结束了，对吧？希望一切顺利——并且有一顿应得的寿司大餐等着你！🍣 我真的很惊讶你知道“压力山大”这个词！这个词真的很有趣——你知道它是怎么来的吗？\n\n你的旅行故事听起来也很棒！我不记得之前有没有提过，但我真的很喜欢大海。所以沿海旅行总是我的首选。上个月，我独自驾车去了中国东南沿海的一个岛屿——大致与台湾相对。不幸的是，那不是一次完美的旅行。那几天有台风经过，原本计划的两人度假（和男朋友）因为一些复杂的情况变成了独自旅行。\n\n不过，我还是在那里拍了一些照片——我会附上几张。不确定我还会不会再回去，但真的很想再去。站在沙滩上，赤脚感受海风拂过，仿佛能重置灵魂。\n\n我真的很能感受到你对中国旅行的热情——加油！不要太紧张。等你有机会来的时候，请让我当你的导游。我保证会让你吃得非常满意。😄\n\n你发的那只小猫的照片简直太可爱了——真希望我的“呆比”也能那么黏人！前几天我不小心踩到了他的一个玩具球，弄坏了，所以给他买了一个新玩具作为补偿。还好，他似乎对我的赔罪礼物很满意。\n\n还有你照片里的那个大电机——是你的项目的一部分吗？我很好奇，什么样的机器会用那么大的电机？\n\n最好的祝福，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nYour letter made my day again — you always have this way of writing that feels calm and genuine, like catching up with a close friend over coffee. I really enjoyed reading it.\n\nYour description of the trees made me laugh — nature’s version of a hair dye job is such a perfect way to put it. I’ve actually noticed the same thing around here lately. Some trees can’t seem to decide if they want to stay green or turn gold, so they just end up somewhere in between. Autumn here is very low-key — the colors aren’t as loud or dramatic, but it’s still autumn in its own quiet way. There’s a certain charm in how subtle it feels, especially around sunset.\n\nIt’s been about ten days since I slowed down a bit to recharge, but I’m planning to get back to training soon — slowly this time. Work’s been strange too, honestly. We’ve been dealing with projects that feel totally outside what we’re used to, and even though it’s been draining at times, it’s also pushed me to think differently. I guess that’s how growth usually feels — messy but worth it.\n\nAs for The Walking Dead, I actually finished it recently — all the seasons. And I still can’t stop thinking about it. The choices I made, the characters I got attached to, the way it all wrapped up — it really hit me. Lee Everett, the main character of the first season, definitely became one of my top 10 video game protagonists of all time. He’s so well written that he doesn’t even feel like a character — more like a real person you’ve known and lost. I loved it so much. And after what you said, Disco Elysium sounds like something I’d connect with too — I’ll definitely give it a try when I’m in the mood for something deep and thoughtful.\n\nAbout the hair — mine’s wavy with a lot of volume in the back and sides. Even though it looks aesthetically nice once I’m done styling it, it keeps covering my glasses and staining them, so I tie it when I work to stay sane. I’ve also started wearing a satin bonnet when I sleep — it’s honestly a quality-of-life improvement. You should look it up if you’re thinking of keeping yours shoulder length; it helps a ton with frizz and tangles.\n\nI really understood what you said about being a “reliable tool.” That line hit hard. It’s tough when people depend on you for what you do, but forget who you are. I hope when you finally take that step back, you get to create on your own terms — I can already tell whatever you make will have that same honesty your writing carries.\n\nI really appreciate your letter, Dominoh. You’re the only person on this app who’s been consistent and sincere in writing to me. Some people send one or two letters and then just ghost — I don’t get mad about it, but I put a lot of effort into my replies, only for them to disappear. It shows they don’t really understand the true meaning of this app — it’s about slowing down and taking your time with the letters you send, not just surface-level chat. It’s about building something real, and I can’t complain… because I got one true friend here.\n\nTake care of yourself, Domino. Your letters always arrive right when I need a bit of calm — like a short pause in the middle of a noisy day.\n\nUntil next time, friend,\nMoni\n\nP.S. That sunset photo was beautiful. You’ve always had a way of capturing moments that feel alive — there’s warmth in every shot you take, like you somehow photograph emotion itself.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n你的来信再次点亮了我的一天——你总是能写出那种平静而真挚的文字，就像和老朋友在咖啡馆里闲聊一样。我真的很喜欢读你的信。\n\n你对树木的描述让我笑了——把自然界的换季比作染发，真是太贴切了。其实我最近也注意到了同样的情况。有些树似乎拿不定主意是要保持绿色还是要变成金色，所以它们就处在两者之间。这里的秋天非常低调——色彩没有那么鲜艳或戏剧化，但仍然是秋天，只是以一种安静的方式呈现。这种微妙的感觉特别有魅力，尤其是在日落时分。\n\n我已经放慢节奏休息了大约十天，但计划很快重新开始训练——这次会慢慢来。工作方面也有些奇怪，实话实说。我们处理的项目完全超出了我们的常规范围，虽然有时会让人感到疲惫，但也逼着我换一种方式思考。我想，成长通常就是这样的感觉——混乱但值得。\n\n至于《行尸走肉》，我最近刚看完所有季。我到现在还不能停止思考。我所做的选择，我所依恋的角色，以及整个故事的结局——这一切都让我深受触动。第一季的主角李·埃弗雷特，绝对是我心目中有史以来最棒的十位电子游戏角色之一。他写得太好了，以至于你不会觉得他是一个角色，更像是一个你认识并失去的真实人物。我非常喜欢。而且听了你的话，《极乐迪斯科》听起来也是我会喜欢的游戏——等我心情平静时，我一定会试试看。\n\n关于头发——我的头发是波浪形的，后面和两侧有很多蓬松感。虽然造型完成后看起来还不错，但它总是遮住我的眼镜，弄脏镜片，所以我工作时会把它扎起来，以免自己抓狂。我还开始在睡觉时戴丝绸头巾——这真的提高了生活质量。如果你打算留肩长发，可以查一查这个，它对减少毛躁和打结非常有帮助。\n\n我真的很理解你所说的“可靠的工具”那句话。这句话真的触动了我。当人们依赖你所做的事，却忘记了你是谁，这确实很难受。我希望当你最终退一步时，能够按照自己的方式去创造——我从你的文字中已经能感受到，你所创造的一切都会带着同样的真诚。\n\n我非常感谢你的来信，多米诺。你是这个应用上唯一一个始终如一、真诚地给我写信的人。有些人发了一两封信就消失了——我不会生气，但我确实花了很多心思在回信上，结果却石沉大海。这表明他们并没有真正理解这个应用的真正意义——它关乎放慢脚步，认真对待你发送的每一封信，而不仅仅是表面的聊天。它关乎建立真实的关系，我不能抱怨……因为我在这里找到了一个真正的朋友。\n\n照顾好自己，多米诺。你的来信总是在我需要平静的时候准时到达——就像在嘈杂的一天中的一次短暂暂停。\n\n下次见，朋友，\n莫妮\n\nP.S. 那张日落照片真美。你总是能捕捉到那些生动的瞬间——你的每一张照片都充满了温暖，仿佛你拍下的不仅仅是景象，还有情感本身。",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nI saw the photos you took — those trees are fascinating! I’ve never seen ones that only partially change color before; it looks like nature’s version of a hair dye job, haha. There’s something playful about it, like the trees couldn’t quite decide whether they were ready for autumn or not.\n\nI’m really glad to hear your health’s been improving. If you’re planning to get back to training, maybe start with a bit of lighter intensity and give your body some time to readjust. I’m not exactly an expert on fitness, so I can’t offer much technical advice — but I genuinely hope the process goes smoothly, and that it feels good to be moving again rather than stressful.\n\nYou mentioned The Walking Dead again — its storytelling really is impressive. Even though I haven’t played much myself, I’ve heard plenty about how emotionally heavy it can get. Have I ever told you about Disco Elysium? It’s one of my favorite story-driven games. The whole thing feels like stepping inside a well-written novel — dense, philosophical, a little tragic, but deeply human. I think you’d appreciate it if you ever feel like something slower and more introspective.\n\nAnd about the hair — so you’ve started tying it up while working now! That’s such a relatable struggle. I’ve been growing mine since around the COVID years, and it hasn’t been shorter than shoulder-length since then. My boyfriend actually started growing his about a month ago — he’s always loved long hair, and honestly, that’s part of why I’ve kept mine too. I get what you mean about how annoying it can be though: washing it, waiting for it to dry, trying to sleep without it tangling… even after all this time, I still haven’t fully adapted. But there’s something satisfying about seeing it grow, isn’t there? It’s like a quiet record of time passing.\n\nAs for work — thank you for your kind words, really. Reading your message warmed me more than you might realize. I’ve talked to one of my collaborators recently and told them my workload’s pretty much at its limit. It was also my way of quietly signaling that I might step back soon. They didn’t take it very well… I guess that’s one of the downsides of being a “reliable tool” with a not-so-high price tag — people hate letting you go. 😅 Sometimes I feel like I’ve set that trap for myself. Still, I think before the end of this year, I’ll say goodbye to a few (maybe all) of the ongoing projects, take a short break, and finally focus on what I actually want to build.\n\nTake care of yourself, and thank you again for your steady presence. Somehow, your letters always arrive exactly when I need a bit of warmth or reassurance.\n\nUntil next time,\nDomino\n\n P.S. I took the photo below on my way to the café where my boyfriend works — the sun was setting right at the end of the highway. Couldn’t resist capturing that moment.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n我看到了你拍的照片——那些树真有趣！我从未见过只有部分变色的树；看起来像是大自然的染发效果，哈哈。它们有一种顽皮的感觉，好像树自己也拿不定主意是否准备好迎接秋天了。\n\n很高兴听到你的健康状况有所改善。如果你打算重新开始训练，或许可以从低强度开始，给身体一些时间适应。我不是健身专家，所以不能提供太多技术建议——但我真心希望这个过程顺利，重新开始运动的感觉是愉悦的，而不是压力。\n\n你又提到了《行尸走肉》——它的故事讲述确实很出色。虽然我自己玩得不多，但听说它的情感深度非常强烈。你听说过《迪斯科天堂》吗？这是我最喜欢的故事驱动游戏之一。整个游戏就像走进了一本写得很好的小说——内容丰富，哲学意味浓厚，有点悲伤，但又非常人性化。我觉得如果你喜欢慢节奏和内省的游戏，你会喜欢它的。\n\n关于头发——你开始在工作时扎起来了吗！这真是个能引起共鸣的烦恼。自从疫情开始，我就开始留长发，从那以后就没有短过肩。我的男朋友大约一个月前也开始留长发——他一直喜欢长发，老实说，这也是我留长发的原因之一。我明白你所说的那些烦恼：洗头、等它干、睡觉时避免打结……即使过了这么久，我还没有完全适应。但看着它生长确实有一种满足感，不是吗？它就像时间流逝的无声记录。\n\n关于工作——真的非常感谢你的好评。读到你的信息让我感到非常温暖。我最近和一个合作者谈过，告诉他们我的工作量已经接近极限。这也是我悄悄暗示我可能很快会退一步的方式。他们反应不太好……我想，这就是成为“可靠工具”且价格不高的一个缺点——人们不愿意放手。😅 有时候我觉得自己陷入了这个陷阱。不过，我想在今年年底前，我会告别一些（甚至全部）正在进行的项目，休息一段时间，最终专注于我真正想做的事情。\n\n照顾好自己，再次感谢你一直以来的支持。不知为何，你的信总是在我需要温暖或安慰的时候准时到来。\n\n下次见，\n多米诺\n\n附：下面的照片是我去我男朋友工作的咖啡馆的路上拍的——太阳正好在高速公路的尽头落下。那一刻太美了，我忍不住拍了下来。",

    "content": "Hi Domino😉\n\nOkay, first of all — your wasabi trauma story had me laughing so hard!  \"Wasabi is sweet\" is truly one of the cruelest pranks ever. I can only imagine little Domino taking that huge scoop with full confidence, and then...  instant regret! I actually got tricked too, though in a different way. I thought wasabi wouldn't be that strong, so I tried a bigger amount than I should have. Let's just say my sinuses have never been clearer These days, I like wasabi — but in very, very small amounts. Just enough for flavor, not enough to feel like my brain is on fire, 哈哈。\n\nYour road trip stories are absolutely incredible, and honestly, a bit 令人羡慕 (enviable)! Driving from Nanjing all the way to Shenyang to meet your boyfriend in real life? That's so romantic! And then living there for almost a year, exploring Dalian's seafood and Inner Mongolia's salty milk tea and beef... it sounds like such an amazing chapter of your life. I have to admit, I'm a little jealous! 😂 But also really happy to know someone who has such a beautiful, adventurous relationship with their partner. That kind of spontaneity — debating what to eat and then ending up 300 kilometers away — is exactly the kind of life I dream about!\n\nActually, I've had a similar experience, though on a much smaller scale. Sometimes my friends and I would sit around trying to decide where to eat, and after going back and forth for ages, we'd just end up at my place cooking together because we couldn't agree on anything Not quite as adventurous as your 300km seafood trips, but hey, at least we got fed!\n\nSpeaking of which — I would absolutely drive 6-7 hours for perfect seafood too! 我也很喜欢海鲜 (I also love seafood)! Though I have a confession: I'm terrible at eating crab and shrimp. They're so delicious, but so annoying to peel! Usually I just ask my mom or my friends to help me open them I much prefer squid, cuttlefish, and prawns that are already peeled. Less work, more eating, 哈哈。What's your favorite seafood dish?\n\nAnd salty milk tea from Inner Mongolia — now I'm really curious! 听起来很特别 (it sounds very special)! I've never tried it before, but I'd love to someday. Is it actually salty, or is it more like a subtle savory flavor? I'm trying to imagine what it tastes like!\n\nAbout midterms — I haven't taken the exam yet! It's actually tomorrow, and right now I'm buried in preparing a PowerPoint presentation for my project and organizing all the related documents. 压力山大 (the pressure is mountain-high)!  But you know what's keeping me motivated? The fact that in two weeks, I'm finally getting my sushi reward!. I seriously can't wait. I'm already planning my order: salmon sashimi, double unagi roll, unagi yoridori... 我真的等不及了 (I really can't wait)! The anticipation is killing me in the best way possible 😂\n\nYour car looks amazing, by the way! 🚗 Is that your personal car? It looks so sleek and perfect for those long road trips you love. I'm genuinely jealous of that freedom — just getting in the car and driving wherever you want, whenever you want. That's the dream!\n\nAnd that unagi photo?! 😭 Why would you do this to me?! 看起来太好吃了 (it looks so delicious)! Now I'm sitting here craving unagi even more than before, and I still have two weeks until my sushi reward 🥲 You're making the wait so much harder, haha!\n\nI've done some road trips too, though mostly around Sumatra — places like Riau, Kepulauan Riau, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra. I haven't explored Java or Bali yet because, honestly, the flight prices are insane. A round-trip ticket to Bali costs about the same as flying to Thailand! 太贵了 (too expensive)! So for now, I'm sticking to local Sumatra adventures. But one day, I'll make it to Java and Bali... and one day, 我会去中国 (I'll go to China)!\n\nSpeaking of which — I am SO excited about your invitation! 真的很感激 (I'm really grateful)! 🥰 Honestly, knowing that I'll have a friend like you in China when I eventually make it there makes the dream feel so much more real. I'm already imagining us going on food adventures together — trying amazing restaurants, exploring hidden food spots, maybe even doing a spontaneous road trip for the perfect meal, just like you and your boyfriend used to do! 😄\n\nI'm not sure when I'll be able to go — 什么时候呢？(when will it be?) — but when I do, you'll be the first person I contact. That's a promise! Consider yourself my official China food tour guide 😂 I hope you're ready, because I'm definitely going to take you up on that offer!\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for sharing your stories and for being so supportive of my dreams. It really means a lot. 我很幸运认识你 (I'm very lucky to know you)! 💙\n\n祝你一切顺利 (wishing you all the best), and I'll update you after my exam and sushi reward mission! 🍣🎉\n\nBest,  \nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino😉\n\n首先——你的芥末创伤故事让我笑得前仰后合！“芥末是甜的”这真是史上最残忍的恶作剧之一。我只能想象，小Domino满怀信心地舀了一大勺，然后……瞬间后悔！其实我也中过招，不过方式不同。我以为芥末不会那么辣，所以试了一大勺，结果我的鼻窦从来没有这么通透过。现在，我喜欢芥末——但量一定要非常非常小。只要有一点点提味，不至于感觉脑袋着火就行，哈哈。\n\n你的公路旅行故事简直太棒了，老实说，还有点令人羡慕！从南京一路开到沈阳见你的男朋友？这太浪漫了！然后在那里住了将近一年，探索大连的海鲜和内蒙古的咸奶茶和牛肉……这听起来是你生命中非常精彩的一章。我得承认，我有点嫉妒！😂 但也很高兴认识一个和伴侣有如此美好、冒险关系的人。这种随性——争论吃什么然后最终跑到300公里外——正是我梦想中的生活！\n\n其实，我也经历过类似的事情，虽然规模小得多。有时候我和朋友们坐在一起，讨论去哪里吃，讨论了好久最终还是决定在我家做饭，因为我们谁也说服不了谁。虽然没有你300公里的海鲜之旅那么冒险，但至少我们吃上了！\n\n说到这个——我绝对会为了完美的海鲜开6-7个小时的车！我也很喜欢海鲜！不过我得坦白：我吃螃蟹和虾很糟糕。它们太好吃了，但剥壳太麻烦！通常我会请妈妈或朋友帮我剥。我更喜欢已经剥好的鱿鱼、墨鱼和虾。少点麻烦，多点享受，哈哈。你最喜欢的海鲜是什么？\n\n还有内蒙古的咸奶茶——现在我真的很好奇！听起来很特别！我从未尝试过，但真的很想有一天能尝尝。它真的咸吗，还是更像是一种微妙的咸味？我正在想象它的味道！\n\n关于期中考试——我还没有考！其实明天就要考了，我现在正忙着准备项目用的PPT和整理所有相关文件。压力山大！但你知道什么让我保持动力吗？两周后，我终于可以得到我的寿司奖励了！我简直等不及了。我已经计划好要吃什么：三文鱼刺身、双份鳗鱼卷、鳗鱼拼盘……我真的等不及了！这种期待的感觉太棒了，虽然也让人有点焦虑😂\n\n对了，你的车看起来真棒！🚗 是你自己的车吗？看起来非常酷，非常适合你那些长途旅行。我真的很嫉妒那种自由——随时想走就走，想去哪儿就去哪儿。那才是梦想中的生活！\n\n还有那张鳗鱼的照片？😭 你为什么要这样对我？！看起来太好吃了！现在我坐在这里，比之前更想吃鳗鱼了，而我还要等两周才能吃到寿司 🥲 你让等待变得更难了，哈哈！\n\n我也去过一些地方，不过主要是苏门答腊岛——比如廖内、廖内群岛、北苏门答腊和西苏门答腊。我还没去过爪哇或巴厘岛，因为说实话，机票太贵了。往返巴厘岛的机票和飞泰国的价格差不多！太贵了！所以现在我只能在苏门答腊岛探险。但总有一天，我会去爪哇和巴厘岛……总有一天，我会去中国！\n\n说到这个——我对你发出的邀请真的非常激动！真的很感激！🥰 说实话，知道我最终去中国时会有你这样的朋友，让这个梦想显得更加真实。我已经在想象我们一起去美食探险——尝试美味的餐厅，探索隐藏的美食地点，也许还会像你和你的男朋友那样，为了完美的餐点来一次说走就走的旅行！😄\n\n我还不确定什么时候能去——什么时候呢？——但当我去了，你一定是第一个我联系的人。这是我的承诺！你就当我是你的官方中国美食导游吧😂 希望你做好准备，因为我一定会接受你的邀请！\n\n无论如何，非常感谢你分享你的故事，也感谢你对我的梦想如此支持。这真的意义重大。我很幸运认识你！💙\n\n祝你一切顺利，考完试和寿司奖励任务后我会更新！🍣🎉\n\n最好的祝福，  \nKel",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nReading your letter truly made me smile. I can imagine how overwhelming it must be to juggle three projects at once, and I’m glad you’re thinking about letting go of the smaller, low-priority ones. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that protecting your own time and energy is just as important as meeting deadlines. I’ve been noticing the same on my end — handling projects outside of our usual niche has been a challenge, but it’s also a chance to grow and learn new ways of working. There’s a strange satisfaction in navigating uncertainty, even if it means constantly adjusting and figuring out what works. It’s like walking through a forest you’ve never been in before — intimidating at first, but exciting once you start noticing the paths.\n\nThe three pictures you sent of the road that leads up to Purple Mountain are absolutely stunning. That is pure autumn energy! I honestly thought New York had the best autumn vibe, but your photos and your description have me reconsidering. The golden canopy, the soft sunlight filtering through the branches, and the calm feeling that comes with the crisp air — it’s magical. Knowing the history behind those trees makes it feel even more alive, almost like they carry stories from a century ago. I could almost hear the leaves rustling and smell the faint earthy scent after rain. Pure magic.\n\nAutumn here in Maadi is a little underwhelming in comparison, haha. The trees don’t really turn yellow or orange; only the very tops show hints of change. Days are still warm, though the evenings carry a slight coolness, which is nice. Even with that, I still prefer winter here — there’s something peaceful about the contrast of cooler nights and warmer days. The sunlight is softer too, casting a different kind of golden glow over the streets and buildings. It’s subtle, but in its own way, it makes the city feel calm and reflective, and I try to notice those little moments when I can.\n\nIt’s already been 10 days since I started my break from everything besides work, but I’m planning for my comeback to all my activities. I want to get back into the gym, my side projects, and all the little routines that make my days feel full. It’s motivating to think about diving back in, and having had this small pause makes me feel ready to approach everything with a fresher perspective. I’ve been catching up on movies, shows, and games in the meantime — I just finished the first season of The Walking Dead, and it really hit me like a dashing train. The episodic format across seasons one through three makes every decision feel weighty, and I love how the story unfolds based on the choices you make. I’d genuinely recommend it if you like games that let your actions shape the narrative.\n\nOh, and a silly little note — my hair has finally reached medium length, so I started tying it up while working. I truly want to grow it even further, but managing it and getting enough sleep has been such a battle. I’m fighting the urge to just go for a clean buzz cut, so tying it up is my little sanity-saving compromise for now.\n\nI feel like I’m slowly learning how to give myself permission to take things at my own pace, which has been comforting. Life can be so busy and chaotic that it’s easy to forget how good it feels to just slow down and enjoy the little things — even if it’s a quiet afternoon, a walk outside, or a small ritual like catching a game or reading a story. I’m trying to appreciate these moments while I can.\n\nTake care of yourself too, Domino. Don’t let the projects steal your calm — you deserve that quiet golden tunnel of leaves, even if only in your mind for a moment. I hope you’re finding space to breathe and enjoy small moments for yourself, just like the autumn streets you captured in those photos.\n\nWarmly,\nMoni\n\nP.S. Those are the shots I took — I tried to give it my best",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n读你的信让我真心笑了。我能想象同时处理三个项目是多么令人应接不暇，很高兴你正在考虑放弃那些较小、优先级较低的项目。有时候我们很容易忘记，保护自己的时间和精力与完成截止日期一样重要。我在这方面也有同感——处理我们通常领域之外的项目确实是个挑战，但这也是成长和学习新工作方式的机会。在不确定中找到出路有一种奇怪的满足感，即使这意味着不断调整和摸索。这就像走进一片从未踏足的森林——一开始令人畏惧，但一旦开始注意到那些路径，就变得兴奋起来。\n\n你发来的三张通往紫金山的路的照片真是太美了。那完全是秋天的气息！我本以为纽约的秋天氛围最好，但你的照片和描述让我改变了看法。金色的树冠，阳光透过枝叶洒下，清新的空气中带来的宁静感——这一切都太神奇了。了解这些树背后的历史，让它们仿佛承载着百年前的故事。我几乎能听到树叶沙沙作响，闻到雨后淡淡的泥土气息。真是魔法般的体验。\n\n相比之下，马迪的秋天就显得有些平淡了，哈哈。这里的树不会变成黄色或橙色，只有树梢上有些许变化。白天依然温暖，但晚上带有一丝凉意，这倒也不错。即便如此，我还是更喜欢这里的冬天——凉爽的夜晚和温暖的白天之间的对比有一种宁静之美。阳光也更加柔和，给街道和建筑物披上了一层不同的金色光辉。这种美很微妙，但以它独特的方式让城市显得平静而深沉，我会尽量留意这些小小的时刻。\n\n我已经休息了10天，除了工作之外的其他事情都暂停了，但我计划重新投入所有活动。我想回到健身房，继续我的副业，恢复那些让我的日子充实的小习惯。想到重新投入其中就感到很有动力，而这段短暂的暂停让我感到准备好了以全新的视角面对一切。这段时间我一直在追电影、剧集和游戏——刚刚看完《行尸走肉》第一季，它真的像一列疾驰的火车一样冲击了我。第一季到第三季的分集格式让每一个决定都显得至关重要，我喜欢故事根据你的选择展开的方式。如果你喜欢那些让你的行动塑造叙事的游戏，我真心推荐你试试。\n\n哦，还有一件小事——我的头发终于长到中等长度了，所以开始在工作时扎起来。我真的很想再留长一些，但管理头发和保证充足睡眠真的是一场战斗。我努力克制住直接剃个光头的冲动，所以扎起来成了我暂时的妥协，也是保持理智的小方法。\n\n我觉得我正在慢慢学会允许自己按自己的节奏行事，这让我感到安慰。生活可以如此忙碌和混乱，以至于我们很容易忘记放慢脚步、享受小事的美好感觉——无论是安静的下午、散步，还是像看比赛或读故事这样的小仪式。我会尽量珍惜这些时刻。\n\n多米诺，你也要照顾好自己。不要让项目夺走你的平静——你值得享受那条宁静的金色林荫道，即使只是在脑海中片刻。希望你也能找到呼吸和享受小时刻的空间，就像你在照片中捕捉到的那些秋天的街道。\n\n温暖地，\n莫妮\n\nP.S. 这些是我拍的照片——我尽力了。",

    "content": "Hi Lamine,\n\nI think horse riding is really cool — I hope you’ll have a great time once you join the club. It sounds like something that could bring you a bit of peace, and maybe even new inspiration.\n\nAs for work… I completely understand how you feel. Lately, I’ve also been feeling exhausted from juggling too many things at once. I’m currently handling several different projects, and trying to split my time among them is starting to wear me down. The rhythm feels too tight, and sometimes I wonder if I should let go of some of the smaller, low-paying tasks just to breathe again. It’s strange how easily work can start to eat away at your joy — even the things you once liked can begin to feel heavy. So when you say you’ve been anxious and lost, I really get it. Sometimes just holding on and waiting for the next phase — like your new job — is already a brave kind of patience.\n\nHere in Nanjing, autumn has arrived. The nights are getting colder, around 10°C now, and the leaves of the French sycamores are starting to turn gold. Back in the early 20th century, when Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China, the leader ordered sycamores to be planted all over the city to please his wife. Over the decades they’ve grown into huge trees that now cover the streets with golden leaves every fall. It’s the most beautiful season here — the air feels clear, calm, and a little nostalgic. I'm attacking some of the photos of a famous road with the trees taken in autumn (not by me though )\n\nWhat’s autumn like in Mali? Or does the climate there stay warm most of the year?\n\nOh, and about Debbie — I should’ve clarified this earlier 😅 He’s actually a boy! His name tends to confuse people because it sounds feminine in English, but it’s just a translated version of the Chinese name 呆比 I gave him(yah it means idiot). In the end, I think it suits his personality — he’s fluffy, grumpy, and always pretending to be more dignified than he really is.\n\nTake care, Lamine. I hope your mood lifts a little soon. And when your new job starts, I hope it gives you not just a bit of stability, but also a sense of direction again.\n\nDomino 🐈‍⬛",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine，\n\n我觉得骑马真的很酷——希望你加入俱乐部后会玩得很开心。这听起来像是能给你带来一些平静的事情，甚至可能带来新的灵感。\n\n至于工作……我完全理解你的感受。最近，我也因为同时处理太多事情而感到疲惫。我目前正在处理几个不同的项目，试图在它们之间分配时间已经开始让我感到疲惫。节奏感觉太紧了，有时候我在想是否应该放弃一些较小的、报酬较低的任务，让自己喘口气。工作很容易就开始侵蚀你的快乐——即使是曾经喜欢的事情也开始变得沉重。所以当你说到你感到焦虑和迷茫时，我真的很能理解。有时候，只是坚持下去，等待下一个阶段的到来——比如你的新工作——已经是一种勇敢的耐心了。\n\n这里在南京，秋天已经到了。夜晚开始变冷，现在大约10°C，法国梧桐的叶子也开始变黄。早在20世纪初，当南京是中华民国的首都时，领导人下令在全城种植梧桐树，以取悦他的妻子。几十年来，这些树已经长成了巨大的树木，每到秋天就覆盖了街道，满眼金黄。这是这里最美丽的季节——空气清新、宁静，带有一丝怀旧。我附上了一些秋天梧桐树大道的照片（虽然不是我拍的）。\n\n你在马里的秋天是什么样的？那里的气候一年中大多数时候都温暖吗？\n\n哦，关于Debbie——我早该澄清一下 😅 他其实是个男孩！他的名字容易让人误解，因为在英语中听起来像女性名字，但这是中文名字“呆比”的译名（是的，这意味着“笨蛋”）。最终，我觉得这个名字很适合他的个性——他毛茸茸的，脾气暴躁，总是假装自己比实际上更有尊严。\n\n保重，Lamine。希望你的心情能快点好起来。等你的新工作开始时，希望它不仅能给你带来一些稳定，还能给你一种方向感。\n\nDomino 🐈‍⬛",

    "content": "Hi Kel,\n\nIt seems our sushi preferences are really close — I also love salmon and unagi, especially that perfect kind of salmon that’s rich but not greasy. Unfortunately, Nanjing isn’t a coastal city, which means getting truly high-quality sashimi here is a bit of a challenge.\n\nThat said, there’s one thing I absolutely can’t stand — wasabi. I have a bit of PTSD from it, honestly. When I was a kid, during my first-ever Japanese meal, one of my relatives told me that wasabi was sweet… and of course, I believed them. So I took a huge scoop of it, straight into my mouth — no hesitation. You can probably imagine what happened next. Ever since that traumatic day, wasabi and I have had an irreparable relationship.\n\nAs for road trips — my favorite ones didn’t actually start from Nanjing, but from Northeast China in a city called Shenyang. I spent almost all of last year living there because my boyfriend was based up north. I actually drove all the way from Nanjing to meet him — yes, it was a “meeting-the-boyfriend-in-real-life” kind of journey — and this year, we both moved back to Nanjing together.\n\nWhile I was living there, I drove around a lot. Sometimes I’d head south to Dalian, a coastal city that used to be one of China’s most important ports — kind of like Hong Kong in its early days. It still has fascinating old international-style buildings, and the seafood there is incredible. I love seafood so much that I’d sometimes drive six or seven hours in a single day just to have a perfect meal.\n\nOther times, I’d go north toward Inner Mongolia, where the salty milk tea and beef are unforgettable. My time in Shenyang was actually really happy. I had just bought my car, so that sense of freedom felt brand new and intoxicating. Sometimes my boyfriend and I would sit in the car debating what to eat for dinner — and half an hour later, we’d find ourselves three hundred kilometers away, eating seafood or grilled beef. That, to me, felt like the ideal kind of life… just a little expensive, haha.\n\nAnd congrats again on your ping-pong victory! 🏓🎉 I bet that victory meal tasted even better than usual.\n\nIt makes me really happy to hear how passionate you are about China. Honestly, it’s a country that’s definitely worth experiencing. If you ever do come here, you have to let me know. I’ll make sure to take you out for some amazing food — that’s a promise. 😄\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n看来我们的寿司口味真的很接近——我也特别喜欢三文鱼和鳗鱼，尤其是那种既丰富又不油腻的完美三文鱼。不过，南京不是沿海城市，所以在这里吃到真正高质量的生鱼片确实有点挑战。\n\n话说回来，有一样东西我绝对不能忍受——那就是芥末。老实说，我对它有点心理阴影。小时候，我第一次吃日本料理时，一个亲戚告诉我芥末是甜的……当然，我信了。于是，我一大勺直接送进嘴里——毫不犹豫。你可以想象接下来发生了什么。从那个创伤性的日子起，我和芥末的关系就再也无法修复了。\n\n至于公路旅行——我最喜欢的其实不是从南京出发的，而是从中国东北的一个城市沈阳。去年几乎一整年我都住在那儿，因为我男朋友当时在北方。我甚至从南京开车去见他——是的，那是一次“见男友”的旅程——今年，我们俩一起搬回了南京。\n\n住在那儿的时候，我经常开车四处游玩。有时候我会往南去大连，一个曾经是中国最重要的港口城市——有点像早期的香港。那里仍然有许多有趣的国际风格建筑，海鲜也非常棒。我太爱海鲜了，有时候会一天开六七个小时的车，只为了一顿完美的餐点。\n\n还有时候，我会往北去内蒙古，那里的咸奶茶和牛肉令人难忘。我在沈阳的时光其实非常快乐。我刚买了车，那种自由的感觉既新鲜又令人陶醉。有时候，我和男朋友会坐在车里讨论晚餐吃什么——半小时后，我们发现自己已经开了三百公里，吃着海鲜或烤牛肉。对我来说，那是一种理想的生活方式……只是有点贵，哈哈。\n\n再次恭喜你乒乓球胜利！🏓🎉 我敢打赌，那顿胜利餐一定比平时更美味。\n\n听到你对中国如此热情，我真的很高兴。说实话，中国确实是一个值得体验的国家。如果你真的来了，一定要告诉我。我会带你去吃一些超赞的美食——这是我的承诺。😄\n\n最好的祝福，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nWork’s been a bit overwhelming lately — I somehow ended up juggling three different projects at once. It’s been tricky trying to give each of them the attention they deserve without burning myself out. I’ve started thinking about letting go of a few smaller, low-paying tasks just to breathe again. Sometimes, earning a little less feels like a fair trade for staying sane. I guess I’m slowly learning that “busy” doesn’t always mean “productive.”\n\nMeanwhile, autumn has really settled into Nanjing. The temperature drops fast here once the season changes — nights are already around 10°C, and the air has that clean, crisp bite that makes you want to walk slower. I think autumn is the most beautiful time of year in this city. You’d probably like it — the streets are lined with towering rows of French sycamores, what we call 法国梧桐.\n\nThere’s a bit of a romantic story behind them. Back in the early 20th century, when Nanjing served as the capital of the Republic of China, the leader at the time — Sun Yat-sen — wanted to make the city greener and more pleasant. His wife, Soong Ching-ling, loved sycamores, so he ordered them to be planted along the main avenues. The trees thrived, and now, nearly a century later, they’ve grown into huge canopies that stretch across both sides of the roads, their branches meeting overhead like a vaulted ceiling of gold every autumn.\n\nOne of the most famous spots is the road that leads up Purple Mountain. In October and November, it turns into a glowing tunnel of yellow leaves, especially when the sun filters through the branches in the late afternoon. I filmed a short project there a few years ago — I couldn’t find the footage anymore, but I still remember the sound of the leaves rustling and the faint smell of the earth after rain. It’s one of those places that makes you feel calm without trying.\n\nWhat’s autumn like in Egypt? Or does the weather stay warm for most of the year? I imagine the light must look beautiful in a different way — softer maybe, more golden against the desert tones. I’ve always wondered how the seasons feel there, since I only know Egypt through pictures and stories.\n\nAnyway, I hope you’re feeling better and taking care of yourself. I know you’ve had a rough stretch lately, so please don’t rush to return to your full rhythm right away.\n\nTake care,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n最近工作有点让人应接不暇——不知怎么的，我同时接手了三个不同的项目。试图给每个项目应有的关注而不让自己筋疲力尽，这确实有点棘手。我开始考虑放弃一些较小的、报酬较低的任务，只是为了能喘口气。有时候，少赚一点似乎是为了保持理智的公平交易。我想我正在慢慢明白，“忙碌”并不总是意味着“高效”。\n\n与此同时，南京的秋天已经完全降临。这里的季节一变，气温就迅速下降——晚上已经降到10°C左右，空气里有一种清新、凛冽的感觉，让人想放慢脚步。我觉得秋天是这个城市最美丽的季节。你可能会喜欢这里——街道两旁种满了高大的法国梧桐。\n\n这些树背后还有一个浪漫的故事。20世纪初，南京作为中华民国的首都，当时的领导人孙中山想让城市变得更绿、更宜人。他的妻子宋庆龄喜欢梧桐树，所以他下令在主要街道上种植梧桐树。这些树茁壮成长，近一个世纪后，它们已经长成了巨大的树冠，横跨道路两侧，枝叶在秋天像金色的拱顶一样在头顶交汇。\n\n最著名的地方之一是通往紫金山的那条路。每年10月和11月，它变成了一条金黄色的隧道，尤其是当下午晚些时候阳光透过树枝洒下来时。几年前我在这里拍摄了一个短片——虽然找不到那段视频了，但我仍然记得树叶沙沙作响的声音和雨后大地的淡淡气息。这是一个让你感到平静的地方，无需刻意。\n\n埃及的秋天是什么样的？或者天气大部分时间都保持温暖吗？我想象那里的光线一定以不同的方式显得美丽——也许更柔和，更金色，与沙漠的色调相映成趣。我一直很好奇那里的季节感觉如何，因为我对埃及的了解仅限于图片和故事。\n\n无论如何，希望你感觉好些了，照顾好自己。我知道你最近过得很艰难，所以请不要急于马上恢复到原来的节奏。\n\n保重，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hi Domino😆😆\n\nOkay, first of all — **SEARED FOIE GRAS SUSHI?!** 🤯 That sounds absolutely incredible! I've tried foie gras sushi before and it's just on a whole different level. The richness, the texture, the way it melts... 太好吃了! Now I'm sitting here craving it, and it's not even close to my sushi reward time yet 😂\n\nYour sushi taste is seriously elite! I'm more of a **sanshoku maguro don, double unagi roll, and unagi yoridori** kind of person. Basically, if it has unagi (eel), I'm all in. There's something about that sweet glaze and the tender texture that just hits the spot every single time 🍱 But honestly, I love trying everything on the menu!\n\nI totally feel you on the Hamasushi vs Sushiro dilemma. It's so frustrating when your favorite place is over 100 kilometers away! I mean, I love sushi, but would I drive that far for it? ...Okay, maybe I would 😅 The struggle is real! At least you have that small Japanese restaurant in Nanjing with amazing foie gras sushi — that sounds like a hidden gem! Thanks for sharing the photos, by the way. Now I'm even more motivated to ace my midterms so I can justify my sushi reward 🍣\n\nSpeaking of which — **midterms are next week!** So I haven't gotten my sushi yet, but trust me, it's happening the moment I'm done. I'm already planning my order in my head: probably starting with salmon sashimi, then moving on to the unagi rolls, and finishing strong with a don bowl. The anticipation is half the fun, right? 😄\n\nAbout your **work philosophy** — I really respect that! \"Comfort and fulfillment first, salary second\" is such a healthy mindset, and honestly, not enough people think that way. I can totally understand why the office \"glass box\" life feels uncomfortable. You seem like someone who thrives with **freedom and flexibility** rather than rigid structures. Life's too short to feel trapped in something that doesn't bring you joy, right?\n\nI'm kind of in between, I think. I can adapt to different environments — whether it's structure or freedom, I can roll with it. But deep down, I also value having the space to breathe and do things my own way. So yeah, I get where you're coming from!\n\nThanks for the **honest take on working in China**! I really appreciate you being real about the challenges. The visa sponsorship, the language barrier outside tier-1 cities, the system not being super foreigner-friendly — it's all stuff I need to keep in mind. But honestly? **I'm still excited about it.** It's my dream, and I know it won't be easy, but that's kind of the point, right? I want to challenge myself, immerse in the culture, and really *live* there, not just visit.\n\nThat's actually one of the reasons I'm trying to make friends in China through Slowly! 😊 I figure if I have friends there, it'll make the transition way smoother when I eventually make the move. Plus, I'll have people to hang out with, explore cities with, and maybe even get insider tips on the best food spots (like that foie gras sushi place you mentioned 👀). So yeah, still very much pursuing that dream!\n\nYour **road trip octopus map** sounds amazing, by the way! 🐙🚗 I love that visual — Nanjing in the center with driving tentacles stretching out everywhere. That's such a cool way to explore! I'm definitely into road trips too. There's something freeing about just getting in a car (or on a bike) and going somewhere new without too much planning. Do you have a favorite nearby city you've driven to? Or a memorable road trip moment?\n\nHere in Indonesia, I don't do as many road trips since I'm still a student and don't have a car, but I love the *idea* of it. I do get out and explore when I can, though — whether it's hopping on a motorbike or just wandering around. And hey, **speaking of unwinding** — last weekend I played ping pong with my friends and I actually WON! 🏓🎉 Which means they had to treat me to food afterward. Best. Feeling. Ever. There's nothing quite like victory snacks, haha.\n\nAnyway, I hope your week is going well! Enjoy those road trips, keep hunting for good sushi, and maybe one day we can compare notes on the best sushi spots in China vs Indonesia 😄\n\nOh, and to answer your question: my go-to sushi order is basically **anything with unagi** and a side of salmon sashimi. What about you — besides foie gras and sashimi, do you have any other must-orders?\n\nLooking forward to your next letter!\n\nBest,  \nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino😆😆\n\n首先——**炙烤鹅肝寿司？**🤯 听起来太棒了！我之前试过鹅肝寿司，那真是不同凡响。那种浓郁的口感，入口即化……太好吃了！现在我坐在这里都开始流口水了，而我的寿司奖励时间还早着呢 😂\n\n你的寿司品味真的很高！我更喜欢**三色金枪鱼丼、双份鳗鱼卷和鳗鱼盖饭**。基本上，只要有鳗鱼，我就会全情投入。那种甜美的酱汁和嫩滑的口感，每次都能让人满足 🍱 但说实话，我也喜欢尝试菜单上的每一样东西！\n\n我完全理解你对Hamasushi和Sushiro的纠结。当你的最爱距离超过100公里时，真的让人很头疼！我是说，我爱寿司，但我会为了它开那么远的车吗？……好吧，也许我会 😅 真的是个难题！至少你在南京有那家小日本餐厅，有美味的鹅肝寿司——听起来像是个隐藏的宝藏！谢谢分享照片，现在我更有动力好好准备期中考试，这样就可以心安理得地享受我的寿司奖励 🍣\n\n说到这个——**期中考试下周就要开始了！** 所以我还没吃到寿司，但相信我，考试一结束我就去。我已经在心里计划好要点什么了：大概是从三文鱼刺身开始，然后是鳗鱼卷，最后以一碗盖饭收尾。期待本身就是一种乐趣，对吧？😄\n\n关于你的**工作理念**——我真的很佩服！“舒适和满足第一，薪水第二”是一种非常健康的心态，老实说，不是每个人都能这么想。我完全理解为什么办公室的“玻璃盒子”生活会让你感到不自在。你看起来像是一个需要**自由和灵活性**而不是僵化结构的人。人生太短暂了，不能被困在不让自己快乐的事情上，对吧？\n\n我觉得我介于两者之间。我可以适应不同的环境——无论是有结构的还是自由的，我都能应对。但内心深处，我也希望有空间呼吸，按自己的方式做事。所以，我理解你的想法！\n\n谢谢你的**对中国工作的真诚看法**！我真的很感激你坦诚地分享了挑战。签证赞助、一线以外城市的语言障碍、系统对外国人的不友好——这些都是我需要考虑的问题。但老实说？**我还是很兴奋。** 这是我的梦想，我知道不会容易，但这正是重点，对吧？我想挑战自己，沉浸在文化中，真正地*生活*在那里，而不仅仅是旅游。\n\n这其实是我通过Slowly在中国交朋友的原因之一！😊 我觉得如果有朋友在那里，当我最终搬家时，过渡会顺利得多。而且，我会有朋友可以一起玩，一起探索城市，甚至可以得到一些关于最佳美食地点的内部消息（比如你提到的那家鹅肝寿司店 👀）。所以，我还是非常追求这个梦想！\n\n你的**章鱼地图公路旅行**听起来太棒了！🐙🚗 我喜欢那个视觉——南京在中心，驾驶的触角伸向四面八方。这是一种很酷的探索方式！我也很喜欢公路旅行。没有什么比开车（或骑车）去一个新地方，不作太多计划更自由的了。你有最喜欢的城市吗？或者有什么难忘的公路旅行经历？\n\n在这里的印尼，我还没有那么多公路旅行，因为我还是学生，也没有车，但我喜欢这个**放松**的主意。我尽可能地出去探索——无论是骑摩托车还是随便走走。顺便说一句，**说到放松**——上周末我和朋友们打乒乓球，我竟然赢了！🏓🎉 这意味着他们得请我吃东西。最好的感觉莫过于此了。胜利后的美食，哈哈哈。\n\n总之，希望你这一周过得顺利！享受那些公路旅行，继续寻找美味的寿司，也许有一天我们可以比较一下中国和印尼最好的寿司店 😄\n\n哦，对了，回答你的问题：我的首选寿司订单基本上是**任何有鳗鱼的**，再加一份三文鱼刺身。你呢——除了鹅肝和刺身，还有什么必点的吗？\n\n期待你的下一封信！\n\n最好的祝福，  \nKel",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nReading your letter genuinely warmed me — thank you for caring and for reminding me to slow down. It means a lot, truly. Sometimes I forget that it’s okay to pause without feeling guilty about it, that not everything needs to be pushed through. I’ve been taking things slowly, trying to listen more closely to what my body’s actually saying instead of rushing back into routine. It feels strange, but also… peaceful in its own quiet way.\n\nI can imagine how draining it must be, giving your time and energy to so many people while your own work waits in the background. I think it’s brave — and honestly very wise — of you to recognize that pattern and start reclaiming your focus. It’s not easy setting boundaries when your instinct is to help, but it’s necessary. I’ll be cheering for you as you find that rhythm again. You’ve got this.\n\nAnd haha, I can’t believe Debbie’s a boy — that actually makes the name even more endearing. He really does look adorable though; the kind of pet that has a whole personality behind those eyes.\n\nAs for The Walking Dead, I’m still in Season 3 right now. It’s made in an episodic format — each season unfolds like a series of chapters, carrying your choices forward from one to the next. The pacing can feel slow at times, but that’s what gives it depth. It’s not just about survival; it’s about people, morality, and the weight of every decision you make. I think you’d appreciate the writing when you’re in the mood for something patient but powerful.\n\nTake care of yourself, Domino. Don’t forget to breathe between projects, and keep that gentle pace you mentioned — it’s the one that truly lets you live, not just exist.\n\nWarmest regards,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n读到你的信真的让我感到温暖——谢谢你关心，也提醒我要放慢脚步。这对我来说意义重大，真的。有时候我会忘记，停下来并没有什么可内疚的，不是所有事情都需要硬撑过去。我一直在慢慢来，试着更仔细地倾听身体的实际需求，而不是急着回到日常生活中。这感觉有些奇怪，但也有一种平静，一种属于它自己的宁静。\n\n我能想象，把时间和精力投入到那么多人身上，而自己的工作却在背后等待，这该是多么令人疲惫。我觉得你能够意识到这一点，并开始重新找回自己的专注力，这是非常勇敢和明智的。设定界限并不容易，尤其是当你的本能是去帮助别人时，但这却是必要的。我会为你加油，相信你能再次找到那个节奏。你一定可以的。\n\n哈哈，我简直不敢相信Debbie是只公猫——这反而让这个名字更加可爱了。他看起来真的很可爱；那双眼睛背后仿佛有着丰富的个性。\n\n至于《行尸走肉》，我现在还在第三季。它是以剧集的形式制作的——每一季都像一系列章节，将你的选择从一个章节带到下一个。有时候节奏会显得有些慢，但这正是它深度的来源。这不仅仅关于生存，更关乎人性、道德以及每一个决定的分量。我想当你想看一些节奏缓慢但充满力量的作品时，你会欣赏它的剧本。\n\n照顾好自己，Domino。在项目之间别忘了呼吸，保持你提到的那种温和的节奏——这才是真正让你生活，而不仅仅是存在的节奏。\n\n最温暖的问候，\nMoni",

    "content": "Hey Domino,\n\nCool! It's fascinating that once our brain learns how to ride a bike or motorcycle, it never forgets.\nIt's a good idea to buy an electric bike. I think it will save you money because you'll buy less gas for your car. \n\nYes, you're right. I'm starting to distance myself little by little. Actually, I'm usually the one who calls or texts him.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if it's professional horse training or just horse riding, but you can still join the club.

Please keep the “slow, careful” setting on for a while. The world can wait; your health can’t.\n\nAbout The Walking Dead: I’ve watched a little gameplay here and there, but the pacing felt a bit slow for me, so I never dove in. Your take makes me want to give it a fair shot when I’m in the mood for something heavy and patient. Maybe it’s one of those titles that works best when you let it breathe.\n\nLately I’ve noticed my energy getting siphoned into other people’s projects. It’s not their fault, but I’m running on “helpful autopilot,” and my own work is starving. That’s a bad trade. I’m going to map out a cleaner boundary — fewer open tabs in my brain, more focused blocks for my stuff. If I disappear for pockets of time, that’s me trying to rebalance, not me vanishing.\n\nI liked what you wrote about flexible, independent rhythms. Same here — I function best when I can choose my speed. Maybe that’s the homework for both of us this month: protect the pace that lets us stay human.\n\nTake care of yourself, go gentle with the workouts, and keep me posted on how you’re feeling. If you find a film or game that pairs well with a quiet night and a brain that refuses to rush, send it my way.\n\nWarmly,\nDomino\n\nP.S.

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nReading your story about that morning really made me wince — I can’t imagine dragging myself half-conscious to work like that 😅. It sounds like a tough experience, but I get what you mean. Sometimes, when we’re used to pushing through things, it’s hard to tell when our body is genuinely asking us to stop. I guess that’s something I’m still learning too — how to tell the difference between being tired and actually needing rest.\n\nThat Chinese saying, “杞人忧天,” really stuck with me. I’ve never heard it before, but it makes sense. I tend to think a lot (sometimes too much), especially when it comes to health or uncertain things. But you’re right — once you’ve done your part, the rest isn’t really in your control. I think I’m starting to see the beauty in letting things be for once.\n\nActually, this whole health issue started while I was training at the gym. I was in the middle of a set when suddenly my head started spinning — the kind of dizziness that makes you feel like the room itself is rotating. When I stood up from the machine, it honestly felt like everything tilted to the left, and for a second, I thought I might be having a stroke. I remember saying “fuck” under my breath and trying to walk it off, but my lower body started burning, my abs tightened up uncontrollably, and I felt waves of nausea. I somehow made it to the changing room and just sat there for a while, shaking, trying to make sense of what was happening. It was one of the scariest moments I’ve had in a long time.\n\nA good fellow there noticed me sitting like a zombie and came over to check on me. I told him what I was feeling, and it turned out he was a doctor. He quickly diagnosed it as a vasovagal reaction, explaining that I probably just overexerted myself and needed to sit tight and hydrate. He was kind enough to give me a ride home afterward — I was so out of it I didn’t even catch his name. When I got home, I oddly felt like taking a cold shower (which I never do; I usually prefer warm ones). After that, I booked a doctor’s appointment and took the day off work. Thankfully, everything checked out fine — it really was just exhaustion from pushing myself too hard. I’ve been taking it slow since then.\n\nMy break has been surprisingly peaceful since. I’m not used to having this much free time, but it feels refreshing. I’ve been spending it catching up on a few movies and games I left halfway, and honestly, it feels nice doing things just because I want to, without any rush or structure. I actually just finished the first season of The Walking Dead — that game hit me like a speeding train. I didn’t expect it to be that emotional or immersive. If you like games where your actions and decisions shape the story, I really recommend giving it a try. It’s one of those experiences that stays with you long after you finish it.\n\nI liked what you said about maybe being better suited to a flexible, independent life. That actually resonates with me a lot — I think I’m built the same way. There’s something freeing about not being tied to strict routines or having to fit into a certain rhythm. Maybe that’s why I admire how you’ve shaped your own path. It feels like you’ve found a balance between structure and freedom, which is something I’m still working on.\n\nGood luck with your HAM exam preparations — I can tell how much passion you’ve poured into it. I’m sure when the time comes, you’ll pass it easily. I’m looking forward to hearing how your first transmission goes — I feel like it’ll be a special moment for you.\n\nTake care, Domino, and thank you again for the thoughtful words. I really do appreciate the way you see things — it always leaves me reflecting a bit deeper.\n\nLooking forward to your next letter, friend,\nMoni\n\nP.S. Debbie looks absolutely adorable in that picture — she’s got such a gentle, curious expression that just makes you smile.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n读到你那天早上的故事，我真是感同身受——我简直无法想象自己半梦半醒地拖着身体去上班的样子 😅。听上去那真是一段艰难的经历，但我理解你的意思。有时候，当我们习惯了硬撑时，就很难分辨身体是否真的在向我们发出停止的信号。我想这也是我还在学习的事情——如何区分只是累和真正需要休息。\n\n那个中文成语“杞人忧天”真的让我印象深刻。我以前从未听说过，但确实很有道理。我常常想得很多（有时甚至太多），尤其是在健康或不确定的事情上。但你说得对——一旦你尽了自己的一份力，剩下的就不再受你控制了。我想我开始看到顺其自然的美了。\n\n其实，我的健康问题是在健身房训练时开始的。当时我正在做一组训练，突然感到一阵眩晕——那种让你感觉整个房间都在旋转的眩晕。当我从器械上站起来时，真的感觉一切都向左边倾斜了，那一刻我甚至以为自己可能中风了。我记得自己低声咒骂了一句，试图走走看能不能缓解，但我的下半身开始灼烧，腹部肌肉不受控制地紧绷，一阵阵恶心感袭来。我勉强走到了更衣室，坐在那里颤抖，试图弄清楚发生了什么。那真是我很久以来最可怕的一刻。\n\n当时有个好心的家伙注意到我像行尸走肉一样坐着，过来询问我是否需要帮助。我告诉他我的感觉，结果他竟然是个医生。他迅速诊断出我这是血管迷走神经反应，解释说我可能只是过度劳累，需要坐下来休息并补充水分。他非常善良，后来还送我回家——我当时太恍惚了，连他的名字都没记住。回到家后，我莫名其妙地想洗个冷水澡（我通常喜欢洗热水澡）。之后，我预约了医生的检查并请了一天假。谢天谢地，检查结果一切正常——确实只是因为过度劳累导致的。从那以后，我一直放慢了节奏。\n\n我的休息时间意外地平静。我不习惯有这么多空闲时间，但感觉很清新。我一直在补看一些半途而废的电影和游戏，老实说，这种随心所欲地做自己喜欢的事情，没有压力和结构，感觉真好。我刚刚完成了《行尸走肉》第一季——那游戏真的像一辆疾驰的火车一样冲击了我。我没想到它会如此情感丰富和沉浸感十足。如果你喜欢那种你的行动和决定能塑造故事的游戏，我强烈推荐你试试。这是一段即使结束后也会久久留在你心中的体验。\n\n我喜欢你提到的可能更适合灵活独立的生活方式。这确实让我产生了共鸣——我想我也是这样的人。不被严格的日程束缚，不必适应某种特定的节奏，这种自由感真的很吸引人。也许这就是我钦佩你塑造自己人生路径的原因。你似乎找到了结构与自由之间的平衡，这也是我还在努力追求的。\n\n祝你HAM考试准备顺利——我能感受到你对它的热情。我相信到时候你一定能轻松通过。我期待听到你的第一次传输——我觉得那对你来说会是一个特别的时刻。\n\n保重，Domino，再次感谢你的贴心话语。你看待事物的方式总是让我深思。\n\n期待你的下一封信，朋友，\nMoni\n\nP.S. Debbie在那张照片里看起来太可爱了——她那温柔好奇的表情让人忍不住微笑。",

    "content": "Hi Kel,\n\nSpeaking of sushi — I love it too! My favorites are seared foie gras and sashimi. Recently I’ve been going to Hamasushi quite a bit, though honestly it’s more of a compromise than a choice. Their quality control isn’t always consistent. I actually prefer Sushiro, which is another Japanese conveyor-belt chain, but unfortunately they don’t have a branch in Nanjing. If I really wanted to eat there, I’d have to travel over a hundred kilometers… which feels a bit excessive just for sushi, haha.\n\nThere’s a small Japanese restaurant I really like here in Nanjing — they make amazing foie gras sushi. I’ve attached a photo of it below, along with one of Sushiro’s storefront in Hong Kong (I took it during a work trip, though sadly I didn’t get to eat there that time).\n\nAbout work — I’ve always believed that a job should feel comfortable and fulfilling first, and only then should salary come into consideration. That’s also why I said in my last letter that this new office job makes me a bit uncomfortable. I’m not sure how long I’ll keep doing it. Deep down, I think I’m still someone who values freedom over structure.\n\nAs for working in China — I’ve been thinking about what you said. To be honest, for foreigners, China might not be the easiest place to work. It’s not that people are unwelcoming, but the system itself isn’t really designed to attract or support foreign employees. I’m not entirely sure how the work visa process works here, but as far as I know, it usually requires employer sponsorship.\n\nLanguage can also be a barrier — unless you’re in a big first-tier city, English isn’t widely used in daily life, so fluency in Mandarin would be almost essential. But on the bright side, the cost of living here, especially compared to countries at a similar development level, is still relatively low. Once you find your footing, surviving comfortably isn’t too difficult.\n\nSpeaking of relaxing, I’m really into road trips. Whenever I have both money and time, I like taking short drives to nearby cities just to unwind. If you looked at my map history, it’d probably look like an octopus, with Nanjing as the center and little driving “tentacles” stretching out in every direction, haha.\n\nBy the way, your idea of rewarding yourself with sushi after midterms sounds perfect. 🍣 I think food rituals like that make life a lot more bearable. What’s your go-to sushi order?\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n说到寿司——我也非常喜欢！我最喜欢的是煎鹅肝和生鱼片。最近我经常去Hamasushi，不过说实话，这更多的是妥协而不是选择。他们的质量控制并不总是很稳定。我其实更喜欢Sushiro，这是一家日本的回转寿司连锁店，但遗憾的是南京没有分店。如果我真的想吃的话，得跑一百多公里……只是为了寿司，这感觉有点夸张，哈哈。\n\n南京有一家小的日本餐厅，我特别喜欢——他们做的鹅肝寿司非常棒。我附上了一张照片，还有一张我在香港出差时拍的Sushiro店外的照片（虽然那次遗憾没能去吃）。\n\n关于工作——我一直认为，工作首先应该是舒适和充实的，然后才是薪资。这也是为什么我在上一封信中提到，这份新的办公室工作让我有些不自在。我不确定自己会做多久。内心深处，我仍然是一个更看重自由而不是结构的人。\n\n至于在中国工作——我一直在思考你的话。老实说，对于外国人来说，中国可能不是最容易工作的地方。并不是人们不友好，而是整个系统本身并不是为了吸引或支持外国员工而设计的。我不是很清楚这里的工签流程，但据我所知，通常需要雇主担保。\n\n语言也可能是一个障碍——除非你在一线城市，否则日常生活中英语并不广泛使用，所以流利的普通话几乎是必不可少的。但好的一面是，这里的消费水平，尤其是与同等发展水平的国家相比，仍然相对较低。一旦你站稳脚跟，舒适地生活并不是太难。\n\n说到放松，我真的很喜欢自驾游。每当我既有时间和金钱，就喜欢开车去附近的城市放松一下。如果你查看我的地图历史，可能会看到一个以南京为中心，向四面八方延伸的小“触角”，哈哈。\n\n对了，你提到期中考试后用寿司犒劳自己，这个主意太棒了。🍣 我觉得像这样的食物仪式让生活更加美好。你通常会点什么寿司？\n\n最好的祝愿，\nDomino",

    "content": "Hi Domino 😆😆\n\nWow, marriage planning sounds both exciting and overwhelming! I totally get why you'd want to tie it to your boyfriend's Portsmouth memories—that \"return-to-the-past\" honeymoon concept is so romantic. But yeah, I can imagine the UK wedding costs are insane 😅 New Zealand, Guam, or Denmark all sound like beautiful alternatives though! Each has its own charm. Wherever you end up choosing, I'm sure it'll be meaningful. And hey, 搞钱和攒钱 is a universal struggle—we're all in that boat!\n\nIt's really sweet that you're planning this together despite having opposite schedules (you 9-to-5, him on weekends as a barista). That takes effort and intention, which says a lot. I hope the guesthouse trip next week is everything you need it to be—even if it's technically a work-cation, getting paid accommodation and meals while spending time with your boyfriend in beautiful scenery sounds like a pretty solid deal to me! 最近天气变冷了, so cozy vibes incoming, right? Skip the stream-hiking, enjoy the views, shoot some videos, and call it a win 😊\n\nAbout the \"glass box\" office life—I feel you on that one, even though I haven't fully entered the working world yet. Seven or eight hours in one place does sound suffocating. At least campus gives me the illusion of freedom (even if it's just moving between lecture halls and the library 😂). But your warning about \"new kinds of pain waiting in the adult world\" is noted. Welcome to society, 同志—I'm already mentally preparing myself for that reality check.\n\nAs for midterms—still very much buried under assignments, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel! My plan is simple: survive midterms, then reward myself with **sushi**. It's become my little tradition—treating myself to good food after a rough week. The sad part? Right after midterms, there's no break. We go straight back into classes, heading toward finals. 没有休息 (no rest)! But hey, that's student life, right? At least I have sushi to look forward to 🍣\n\nLooking ahead to post-graduation... honestly, I have a lot of thoughts and some anxieties. Part of me wants to **work or continue my studies in China**. I've been learning Mandarin, and the idea of actually living there, immersing myself in the culture and language, is really appealing. But of course, there's that underlying worry about balancing work and personal life once I'm out in the \"real world.\" Will I have time for hobbies? Will I burn out? \n\nFor now, I'm trying to stay grounded by doing things I enjoy—like playing **table tennis (ping pong) with friends**. It's simple, but it helps me disconnect from the stress and just be present for a bit. Do you have anything like that? Something outside of work that helps you recharge?\n\nAnyway, I hope your first week back in the office rhythm went smoothly, and that next week's trip gives you a much-needed change of scenery. Enjoy the guesthouse, the filming, and the quality time with your boyfriend!\n\nTake care, and looking forward to your next update!\n\nBest,  \nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino 😆😆\n\n哇，筹备婚礼听起来既令人兴奋又让人感到压力山大！我完全理解你为什么想要将婚礼与你男朋友在朴茨茅斯的回忆联系起来——那个“回到过去”的蜜月概念真是太浪漫了。不过，英国的婚礼费用确实高得吓人 😅 新西兰、关岛或丹麦听起来都是美丽的选择！每个地方都有它独特的魅力。无论你最终选择哪里，我相信都会很有意义。而且，搞钱和攒钱确实是全世界的难题——我们都面临着这个问题！\n\n你计划这一切尽管你们的时间表相反（你朝九晚五，他周末当咖啡师）真是太贴心了。这需要努力和用心，这说明了很多。希望下周的民宿之旅能如你所愿——即使从技术上来说是工作假期，但有免费的住宿和餐食，还能和男朋友在美丽的风景中度过时光，听起来真的很不错！最近天气变冷了，所以温馨的氛围即将来临，对吧？跳过溪流徒步，享受风景，拍些视频，这就够了 😊\n\n关于“玻璃盒”办公室生活——我完全理解你的感受，尽管我还没有完全进入职场。一天七到八个小时待在一个地方确实让人感到窒息。至少校园生活给了我一种自由的错觉（即使只是在教室和图书馆之间移动 😂）。但你关于“成年世界里等待着新的痛苦”的警告我记住了。欢迎来到社会，同志——我已经开始为这个现实做心理准备了。\n\n至于期中考试——我还在被作业埋没，但隧道尽头已经看到了光明！我的计划很简单：熬过期中考试，然后奖励自己吃**寿司**。这已经成了我的小传统——在艰难的一周后犒劳自己一顿美食。遗憾的是，期中考试结束后没有休息时间。我们直接回到课堂，继续向期末冲刺。没有休息！但这就是学生生活，对吧？至少我有寿司可以期待 🍣\n\n展望毕业后的生活……老实说，我有很多想法和一些焦虑。一部分的我想要**在中国工作或继续深造**。我一直在学习普通话，实际生活在中国，沉浸在文化和语言中，这个想法真的很吸引我。但当然，也有一个潜在的担忧，那就是如何在工作和个人生活之间找到平衡。我会有时间做爱好吗？我会不会累垮？\n\n目前，我正试图通过做一些我喜欢的事情来保持脚踏实地——比如和朋友们打**乒乓球**。这很简单，但能帮助我从压力中解脱出来，暂时放松一下。你有类似的事情吗？工作之外有什么能帮助你充电的活动？\n\n无论如何，希望你回到办公室的第一周顺利，下周的旅行能给你带来急需的换景。享受民宿、拍摄和与男朋友共度的美好时光！\n\n保重，期待你的下一次更新！\n\n最好的祝愿，  \nKel",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nI’m really glad to hear your checkup turned out fine. Catching something early and choosing to see a doctor right away is such a good habit — it shows you’re aware of your body and willing to take care of yourself. I can’t say I’ve always done as well in that area. I remember a few years ago I had a bad case of acute gastroenteritis. That morning, I woke up feeling weak and dizzy, but I didn’t realize I was actually sick — I thought maybe I’d just slept poorly. So I dragged myself out of bed, washed up, and took the subway to work half-conscious. It wasn’t until I sat down at my desk that I realized something was seriously wrong. I took half a day off, rushed to the hospital, and only then got the diagnosis 😅.\n\nSo yes, learning to recognize when something’s off and seeking help is really important. But I also think there’s no need to overthink or worry too much once you’ve done your part. I have a friend who tends to spiral easily, always anxious about the worst-case scenario. In Chinese, we call that “杞人忧天 (Qǐ rén yōu tiān)” — a phrase from an old story about a man who spent his days worrying that the sky might fall. It’s a reminder that most of the time, things aren’t as bad as we imagine. Once you’ve taken the right steps, the rest will take care of itself.\n\nAs for me, I’m still preparing for my HAM radio exam. The next test date I could book is in the latter half of this month, so for now I’m just reviewing the material bit by bit whenever I can. One of my current projects has also upgraded recently — my partner rented an office space, so I’ve gone back to something like an office routine. It’s only been about a week, but I already feel slightly out of place. There’s a saying in Chinese, “由奢入俭难,” which means “it’s hard to return to simplicity after getting used to comfort.” I think that perfectly describes how I feel right now. Maybe, in the end, I’m just someone who’s better suited to a more flexible, independent life.\n\nTake care of yourself and keep enjoying your quiet recovery time — sounds like your break is exactly what you needed.\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n很高兴听到你的检查结果一切正常。及早发现问题并及时就医是一个非常好的习惯——这表明你对自己的身体状况有意识，并且愿意照顾自己。我不能说我在这方面总是做得很好。记得几年前，我患上了急性胃肠炎。那天早上，我醒来时感到虚弱和头晕，但并没有意识到自己真的生病了——我以为只是昨晚没睡好。所以我挣扎着起床，洗漱完毕，半梦半醒地乘地铁去上班。直到坐在办公桌前，我才意识到情况严重。我请了半天假，急忙赶往医院，这才得到了诊断 😅。\n\n所以，学会识别身体的异常并寻求帮助真的很重要。但我也认为，一旦你尽了自己的努力，就没有必要过度担忧或焦虑。我有一个朋友很容易陷入焦虑，总是担心最坏的情况。在中文里，我们称这种现象为“杞人忧天 (Qǐ rén yōu tiān)”——一个关于一个整天担心天会塌下来的人的古老故事。这提醒我们，大多数时候，事情并没有我们想象的那么糟糕。一旦你采取了正确的措施，剩下的就会顺其自然。\n\n至于我，我还在准备我的业余无线电考试。我预订的下一次考试日期是在本月的后半段，所以目前我只能在有时间的时候一点点复习材料。我的一个项目最近也有所升级——我的合伙人租了一个办公室，所以我又回到了类似办公室的日常。虽然只有一周的时间，但我已经感到有些不适应。中文里有一句话叫做“由奢入俭难”，意思是“习惯了舒适的生活后，再回到简朴的生活会很难”。我觉得这句话完美地描述了我现在的感觉。也许，最终我还是更适合那种更灵活、更独立的生活。\n\n照顾好自己，继续享受你安静的恢复时间——听起来你确实需要这样的休息。\n\n祝好，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hi Kel,\n\nAbout marriage — yes, it’s actually part of my long-term life plan. I originally thought about getting married in the UK, mostly because my boyfriend studied at the University of Portsmouth, and I liked the idea of turning our honeymoon into a little “return-to-the-past” trip. But after checking the actual process… wow, it turns out getting married in the UK is very expensive. Like, a lot, lot, lot of money. 😅\n\nSo now I’m considering places like New Zealand, Guam, or Denmark instead. But 无论如何, it’s still something that will take quite some time to make happen. For now, the most important mission is — 搞钱和攒钱 — make money and save money.\n\nReading your description of campus life reminded me of my own student days. I wasn’t exactly the model student either, but I was absolutely tortured by endless assignments and projects. So I can totally feel your pain, hahaha. Hang in there — it’s all for the degree! And after graduation… 🥲 well, there will be new kinds of pain waiting in the adult world. Welcome to society, 同志.\n\nThis week was my first one working in an office again, trying to re-adjust to the 9-to-5 rhythm. It’s not exactly stressful, but spending seven or eight hours a day inside a glass box doesn’t make me happy either.\n\nAs you know, my boyfriend’s a barista, so his schedule is the opposite of mine — he works weekends. But next week on his day off, I plan to take him to a small guesthouse village on the outskirts of the city. 最近天气变冷了 (the weather’s getting colder now), so we’ll probably skip the stream-hiking part, but the place has beautiful scenery and, thankfully, fewer people on weekdays.\n\nIt’s not a 100 percent “pure holiday” though — one of my former collaborators reached out recently asking me to shoot some promotion videos there. So, technically, it’s a work-cation. The good part is: he’s covering our accommodation, meals, and fuel costs — so I guess that makes it the kind of deal I can’t say no to.\n\nHow’s your midterm prep going so far? Still buried under assignments, or starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel?\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n关于结婚——是的，这确实是我的长期生活计划的一部分。我原本想在英国结婚，主要是因为我的男朋友在朴茨茅斯大学读书，我喜欢把蜜月变成一次小小的“重返过去”之旅的想法。但查了实际的流程后……哇，原来在英国结婚非常贵。真的，非常非常贵。😅\n\n所以现在我在考虑新西兰、关岛或丹麦等地。但无论如何，这仍然需要相当长的时间才能实现。目前，最重要的任务是——赚钱和攒钱。\n\n读你对校园生活的描述，让我想起了自己的学生时代。我也不算是个模范学生，但确实被无尽的作业和项目折磨得够呛。所以我完全能理解你的痛苦，哈哈哈。坚持住——一切都是为了学位！毕业之后……🥲 嗯，成人世界会有新的痛苦等着你。欢迎来到社会，同志。\n\n这周是我重新回到办公室工作的第一周，试图重新适应朝九晚五的节奏。虽然不算是压力山大，但每天在玻璃盒子里待七八个小时确实让我高兴不起来。\n\n你也知道，我男朋友是个咖啡师，所以他的工作时间跟我完全相反——他周末上班。但下个周末他休息时，我打算带他去市郊的一个小民宿村。最近天气变冷了，所以我们可能不会去溪流徒步，但那里的风景很美，而且工作日人少。\n\n这并不是100%的“纯度假”——最近我的一个前合作者联系我，希望我在那里拍摄一些宣传视频。所以，技术上来说，这是一次工作度假。好的一面是：他负责我们的住宿、餐饮和油费——所以我觉得这是个我无法拒绝的交易。\n\n你的期中准备进展如何？还在被作业压得喘不过气，还是开始看到隧道尽头的光了？\n\n最好的祝愿，\nDomino",

    "content": "Hi Lamine,\n\nDuring the National Day holidays, I rode a few shared electric bikes — you could think of them as “25 km/h budget motorcycles.” Before that, I probably hadn’t ridden one in five or six years, but luckily my balance and handling are still there. Maybe I really do have some kind of bond with two-wheelers.\n\nNanjing’s weather has cooled down a lot these days — the temperature dropped to around 18°C, so I might need to dig out my long sleeves from the back of the closet. That also means the next few months won’t be great for riding; facing cold wind on a bike is never pleasant. Still, I’m thinking about buying a second-hand e-bike for commuting — they’re much cheaper, and under China’s current traffic rules, the line between e-bikes and electric motorcycles is… pretty ambiguous. Once you cover the license plate, it almost feels like being a little outlaw on the road 😏.\n\nI’m really sorry to hear about what happened with your friend. I know it hurts when a friendship fades, but if you’ve truly reached the point where there’s nothing left to talk about, maybe going separate ways isn’t such a bad thing. Sometimes, letting go is a quiet kind of peace.\n\nA horse-riding club though — that sounds fascinating! Is it more like professional equestrian training? I’ve always thought horseback riding feels like a luxury hobby. Is the social meaning of owning or riding a horse different in Mali? I only remember tring it twice in my life: once when I was about ten, learning how to move in rhythm during a trot, and once after university, when I bought a short session at a ranch. But… the horse refused to run because I didn’t have a whip (and maybe because I was too heavy 🥲). No matter how nicely I talked to him, he just walked slowly in circles like a philosopher who’d seen too much of the world.\n\nI don’t really use Instagram(I do have an account tho), but I’m very curious about your visual poetry project. How do you plan to express your poems — with video, or with a mix of text and images? It sounds beautiful, and very you.\n\nAnd oh, I’ve seen that little green dinosaur Yoshi before when I was playing my roomate's NS! Such a cute reference — a perfect name for your cat haha.\n\nAnyway, I really hope everything goes smoothly for you — both with the fuel situation and the friendship. Please send my regards to Yoshi, I hope he's fully recovered from the attack by now. Oh and Debbie says hi⬇️\n\nTake care,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine，\n\n国庆假期期间，我骑了几辆共享电动自行车——你可以把它们想象成“时速25公里的经济型摩托车”。在此之前，我可能已经有五六年没有骑过这种车了，但幸运的是，我的平衡感和操控能力还在。也许我真的和两轮车有某种特殊的缘分。\n\n南京的天气最近凉快了很多——温度降到了大约18°C，所以我可能需要从衣柜的深处翻出长袖衣服了。这也意味着接下来的几个月不太适合骑车；在冷风中骑行从来都不是一件愉快的事。不过，我还在考虑买一辆二手电动自行车作为通勤工具——它们便宜得多，而且根据中国目前的交通规则，电动自行车和电动摩托车之间的界限……相当模糊。一旦遮住车牌，几乎就像在道路上当个小“违法者”呢😏。\n\n听到你朋友的事，我真的很遗憾。我知道当一段友谊逐渐淡去时，那种感觉很不好受，但如果你们真的到了无话可说的地步，也许分道扬镳也不是坏事。有时候，放手是一种无声的平静。\n\n不过，一个马术俱乐部听起来真有趣！这更像是专业的马术训练吗？我一直觉得骑马是一种奢侈的爱好。在马里，拥有或骑马的社会意义是否不同？我这辈子只试过两次骑马：一次是在大约十岁的时候，学习如何在小跑时保持节奏；另一次是在大学毕业后，在一个牧场买了一次短时间的体验。但是……那匹马因为没有鞭子（也许是因为我太重了🥲）而拒绝跑起来。无论我怎么温柔地和它说话，它都只是慢慢地转圈，像一个看透了世事的哲学家。\n\n我其实不怎么用Instagram（虽然我确实有一个账号），但我对你的视觉诗歌项目非常好奇。你打算如何表达你的诗——用视频，还是文字和图片的结合？听起来很美，也很符合你的风格。\n\n哦，我之前在玩室友的NS时见过那只绿色的小恐龙Yoshi！真是个可爱的引用——给你的猫起这个名字太完美了哈哈。\n\n无论如何，我真心希望一切顺利——无论是燃料问题还是友谊。请代我向Yoshi问好，希望他现在已经完全从那次攻击中恢复了。还有，Debbie 说你好⬇️\n\n保重，\nDomino",

I told you so.” You were right; sometimes the body really does just ask for a pause. I think that’s what I needed — a quiet reminder to slow down a little and take better care of myself.\n\nStill, the whole thing made me realize how fragile balance can be. One day everything feels fine, and the next, you’re sitting in a waiting room trying not to let your thoughts spiral. But once I got the all-clear, it felt like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. It’s strange how something as simple as hearing, “you’re fine,” can shift your whole mood and make you feel grateful for things you usually overlook — your health, your energy, your ordinary days.\n\nFor now, I’m on a one-month break from the gym and any extra activities outside of work. So, I suddenly have a lot of free time on my hands. I’m planning to use it to finally catch up on a few shows, movies, and video games — it’s been a while since I’ve done things just because I want to, not because I have to. It feels freeing, in a way, though I still have to keep up with work, haha.\n\nHow are things on your end? Did you ever get to make your first real contact on the radio? I can imagine that moment — the quiet static turning into a human voice from somewhere far away. It must feel surreal.\n\nTake care of yourself, Domino.

I know that talking about family dynamics around sexuality isn't easy, even with people who are supportive. \n\nI really respect your courage in being open about who you are in your daily life. It must be frustrating that your parents want you to stay closeted \"at home\" when literally everyone else in your life already knows about your boyfriend. That kind of selective disclosure has to create some complicated feelings.\n\nThe progress with your dad sounds genuinely meaningful though. The fact that he's thinking ahead about potential grandchildren - even if he asked carefully - shows he's starting to imagine your future in a real, tangible way rather than just avoiding the topic. That's significant growth, even if it's happening slowly. If you don't mind me asking - have you and your boyfriend talked about marriage at all? I'm curious whether that's something you're both considering for the future.\n\nThree years together and living together for a year and a half - that's a real, committed relationship. You two clearly love each other deeply. The way you describe your life together - dinners out, short trips, hot springs - sounds really lovely and grounded.\n\nHaha, Debbie sounds exactly like Luxy! My neighbor's cat also believes that all my belongings are actually hers. I think cats just have this innate sense that humans exist to serve them, and any space we occupy is merely borrowed from their kingdom.\n\nAbout the office transition - I totally understand why you're struggling with it. After experiencing the freedom of freelancing and working from home, having to show up somewhere every day at set times must feel suffocating. 由奢入俭难 is the perfect way to describe it. Give yourself some grace during this adjustment period - you're not failing, you're just adapting to a structure that doesn't naturally fit your working style. Hang in there!\n\nAs for my semester... honestly, I'm drowning. The assignments are so overwhelming that I'm literally joking about wanting to die hahaha. There's just SO MUCH work piling up. I have midterm exams coming up in about 2 weeks, which adds another layer of stress on top of everything else.\n\nHow are things with you and your boyfriend this week? Do you two have plans to go anywhere this weekend to decompress from your new office routine? Maybe a quick escape would help with the adjustment.\n\nKeep pushing through - we're both in our own versions of survival mode right now, but we'll get through it!\n\nBest,\nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino😉😉\n\n谢谢你足够信任我，与我分享如此私密的事情。我知道谈论家庭中的性取向问题并不容易，即使是对支持你的人也是如此。\n\n我真的很钦佩你有勇气在日常生活中坦诚地做自己。你父母希望你在“家里”保持隐秘，而你生活中其他所有人都已经知道你的男朋友，这一定让你感到很沮丧。这种选择性披露一定会带来一些复杂的情绪。\n\n不过，你爸爸的进步确实很有意义。他开始考虑未来可能的孙子孙女——即使他问得很谨慎——这表明他开始以一种真实、具体的方式想象你的未来，而不仅仅是回避这个话题。这是重要的成长，即使进展缓慢。如果你不介意我问——你和你的男朋友谈论过结婚吗？我很好奇这是否是你们俩未来考虑的事情。\n\n三年的恋爱，一年半的同居——这是一段真正、坚定的关系。你们显然深爱着彼此。你描述的你们共同的生活——外出就餐、短途旅行、温泉——听起来真的很美好，也很踏实。\n\n哈哈，Debbie听起来和Luxy一模一样！我的邻居的猫也认为我的所有东西都是她的。我觉得猫天生就有这种感觉，认为人类的存在是为了服务它们，我们占据的任何空间都是从它们的王国借来的。\n\n关于办公室的过渡——我完全理解你为什么会感到挣扎。在经历了自由职业和在家工作的自由之后，每天固定时间去某个地方上班一定让你感到窒息。由奢入俭难，这确实是最恰当的描述。在这段调整期里，对自己宽容一些——你并没有失败，只是在适应一种不符合你工作风格的结构。坚持住！\n\n至于我的学期……老实说，我快淹死了。作业多到让我简直在开玩笑说想死哈哈哈。有太多的工作堆积如山。大约两周后我还有期中考试，这又给其他事情增添了一层压力。\n\n你和你的男朋友这周怎么样？你们这周末有没有计划去哪里放松一下，从新的办公室生活中解脱出来？也许快速逃离一下会有助于适应。\n\n继续坚持下去——我们现在都在各自的生存模式中，但我们会挺过来的！\n\n最好的祝福，\nKel",

They don’t want me to come out “at home,” even though most of my relatives, all my friends, and pretty much everyone I work with already know about my boyfriend.\n\nMy dad took it quite hard at first. But in the past two years, he’s softened up. This New Year, he even asked — very carefully — whether I had plans to adopt a child in the future. Well... I really don’t know. It’s not something I can answer easily, but at least it shows he’s starting to think about it in a more accepting way.\n\nAs for my boyfriend and me, we’ve been together for over three years now, and living together for about a year and a half. When work isn’t too hectic, we go out for dinner, take short trips, or visit a hot spring together. 呆比Debbie doesn’t care about any of it — he believes the whole apartment is his kingdom and we’re just intruders disturbing his royal peace, hahaha.\n\nI’m really glad to hear you’ve been doing well lately. I can tell from your letters that you’re managing a lot but still finding ways to enjoy yourself — that’s a good balance.\n\nMy own schedule has changed recently. One of my freelance projects just entered a new phase, and the biggest change is that I now have to go into an office every day. It’s only been two days so far, and honestly... I already feel uncomfortable. Maybe it’s just the transition from freedom to structure — 由奢入俭难, as we say in Chinese — “it’s hard to go from luxury to restraint.” I’m not sure how long I’ll last, but we’ll see.\n\nHow’s your semester going now? Is the workload still manageable, or has it evolved into a full-blown academic storm?\n\nBest,\nDomin",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n感谢你上次信中说的话——真的让我很感动。既然你提到了家庭，我想我也应该坦诚一些。对我来说，大部分的紧张关系都源于我的性取向。我一直很坦率地表明自己是同性恋——在现实生活中我从不隐瞒。但我的父母……对此有些顾虑。他们不希望我在“家里”出柜，尽管我的大多数亲戚、所有朋友，以及我几乎所有的同事都已经知道我有男朋友了。\n\n我爸爸一开始对此反应很大。但在过去的两年里，他逐渐缓和了态度。今年新年时，他甚至非常谨慎地问过我，未来是否有收养孩子的打算。嗯……我真不知道该怎么回答。这不是一个容易回答的问题，但至少这表明他开始以一种更加接受的态度来思考这个问题了。\n\n至于我和我男朋友，我们已经在一起三年多了，同居也有一年半了。工作不忙的时候，我们会一起出去吃饭、短途旅行，或者泡温泉。呆比Debbie对这一切都不关心——他觉得整间公寓都是他的王国，我们只是打扰他皇家安宁的入侵者，哈哈。\n\n很高兴听到你最近过得不错。从你的信中我能感受到，尽管你有很多事情要处理，但你仍然能找到享受生活的方式——这是一种很好的平衡。\n\n我的日程最近也有所变化。我接的一个自由职业项目进入了新阶段，最大的变化是我现在每天都得去办公室。目前只去了两天，说实话……我已经感到不太自在了。可能是从自由到结构的转变——正如中文所说，“由奢入俭难”——“从奢侈到节俭很难”。我不知道自己能坚持多久，但我们会看看情况如何。\n\n你的学期现在怎么样了？工作量还 manageable 吗，还是已经演变成了一场全面的学术风暴？\n\n最好的祝福，\nDomin",

Otherwise, I hope you'll try to ride a motorcycle more often, so you don't lose your touch. \n\nThe salary for my new job is decent, which is a bit of a relief. But these last two days I've been feeling very depressed. My brain is starting to dwell on negative things again, and on top of that, my only real friend is disappointing me. I feel like our friendship is coming to an end because I'm tired of making an effort, and over time I've realized that we have nothing in common except the fact that we're both gay.\n\nI'm thinking about joining a horse riding club or something similar to relax and meet new people. I've also created an Instagram account. I want to start making videos, staging my poems, and sharing them with others on Instagram.\n\nYoshi is the name of a video game character in the Mario Bros universe, and I'm going to send you a photo of him.\n\nSo how did the party go? I hope you had a great time with your family. My favorite thing about the holidays is the food haha.\n\nYoshi is very moved to know that he has a fan in China, he'll probably brag about it to the other cats in the neighborhood haha.\nBy the way, I'm starting work on November 1st, and there's a huge fuel shortage in Mali at the moment. I just hope it gets sorted out before my first day, otherwise I don't know how I'm going to get to work.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nLamine 🥀",

    "content": "Hi Domino😉😉\n\nHaha, fair warning - if you kidnap Luxy, I'm absolutely kidnapping Debbie in retaliation hahahaha We'll have to arrange a hostage exchange situation where we're both trying to keep each other's cats. Although knowing cats, they'd probably just judge us both for the drama and walk away unimpressed.\n\nAbout the UR3 technical stuff - honestly, I'm still figuring out a lot of it myself. The coordinate tweaking is definitely a challenge, and yeah, gripper width needs adjustment for different objects. As for sensor feedback like vision or force sensing - that sounds amazing but way beyond what I'm capable of right now. Maybe that's a \"future Kel\" problem when I actually understand what I'm doing!\n\nYour middle school hacking phase is seriously impressive though! Creating hidden folders using Explorer bugs and cracking RFID systems while still in school? That's genuinely cool. I can't imagine having that level of technical curiosity and skill at that age.\n\nI'm also terrible at coding - like, really terrible hahaha. I'm a complete noob stumbling through this stuff. Want to learn together? We can be coding disasters side by side, cheating with AI tools and pretending we know what we're doing.\n\nAbout your family situation - I'm not entirely sure what to say, but I want you to know that if you ever need support or someone to talk to, the people around you who make you comfortable are there for that. Sometimes just sharing and asking for help makes things easier. It's good that you're trying to reconnect after needing that distance.\n\nWait, you have a boyfriend?? That's so romantic! And you're living together with him and a roommate - that sounds both cute and chaotic at the same time. I'm honestly a bit envious haha! The drink politics situation with a barista boyfriend and tea purist roommate must lead to some interesting beverage discussions. What's it like living with your partner? Does Debbie approve of him, or is she the jealous type?\n\nMy week has been fun - spent time eating out with friends, which was great. But the assignments are absolutely piling up hahaha. The curse of semester life, I guess. Still working on the robotic arm project among everything else, though progress is slow when you're drowning in other coursework.\n\nHow's your freelance work going? Any interesting projects lately, or still recovering from the Hong Kong jewelry exhibition chaos?\n\nBest,\nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino😉😉\n\n哈哈，提前警告一下——如果你绑架了Luxy，我绝对会绑架Debbie作为报复，哈哈哈。我们得安排一个人质交换，互相照顾对方的猫。不过，以猫的个性，它们可能会觉得我们太戏剧化，不屑一顾地走开。\n\n关于UR3的技术问题——说实话，我自己还在摸索。坐标调整确实是个挑战，而且是的，夹爪宽度需要根据不同的物体进行调整。至于像视觉或力感测这样的传感器反馈——听起来很棒，但对我来说目前还遥不可及。也许等我真正理解了这些，那就是“未来的Kel”要解决的问题了！\n\n不过，你中学时期的黑客经历真的让人印象深刻！利用资源管理器的漏洞创建隐藏文件夹，还在上学时破解RFID系统？这真的很酷。我无法想象在那个年纪能有这么高的技术好奇心和技能。\n\n我也是个编程菜鸟——真的，超级菜鸟哈哈哈。我完全是个新手，摸着石头过河。想一起学习吗？我们可以并肩成为编程灾难，用AI工具作弊，假装我们知道自己在做什么。\n\n关于你的家庭情况——我也不太知道该说什么，但我想让你知道，如果你需要支持或有人倾诉，你周围让你感到舒适的人会为你提供帮助。有时候，分享和寻求帮助会让事情变得容易一些。很高兴你尝试在需要距离之后重新建立联系。\n\n等等，你有男朋友了？！这太浪漫了！你们还和室友一起生活——这听起来既温馨又混乱。我有点羡慕哈哈！有咖啡师男朋友和茶道狂热室友，饮料选择肯定很有趣。和伴侣一起生活感觉怎么样？Debbie喜欢他吗，还是她是个嫉妒的类型？\n\n我的这一周过得挺开心——和朋友们出去吃饭，很棒。不过作业真的堆积如山哈哈哈。大概是学期生活的诅咒吧。我还在继续做机械臂项目，尽管其他课程的压力让我进展缓慢。\n\n你的自由职业工作怎么样？最近有什么有趣的项目吗，还是还在从香港珠宝展的混乱中恢复？\n\n最好的祝愿，\nKel",

    "content": "Hi Kel,\n\nLuxy really is such a perfect name — she has that “I belong everywhere” face. I can totally imagine her walking into your place like she pays rent. If I ever visit Indonesia, I’ll have to resist the urge to kidnap her… or at least negotiate visitation rights with your neighbor first.\n\nThat UR3 project of yours is seriously fascinating. I used to work somewhere that had a robot arm too, though I was only around it — never actually programmed it myself. The interface we used was all GUI, dragging waypoints and pressing buttons instead of writing lines. So your setup feels a lot more direct — you’re literally talking to the machine. I tried reading your screenshots; some of the variable names still go over my head, but I get the idea. You probably have to tweak coordinates and gripper width depending on each object, right? I wonder if the UR3 could take sensor feedback — like vision or force — to correct itself. Maybe that’s beyond its comfort zone for now.\n\nAs for my chaotic “engineer” phase… I was in middle school, armed with a fake USB stick and too much curiosity. I made a tiny program that opened a hidden folder automatically on school PCs, so I could stash my own files there. It used a little Explorer bug that made the folder look like a config file — invisible to most people. I was also briefly obsessed with RFID cards; I somehow cracked the system for our canteen’s stored-value cards. Luckily they upgraded not long after I graduated, or I might’ve been responsible for a school-wide financial crisis.\n\nI don’t really think of myself as good at programming — I’m not built for pure logic. I even chose a major without advanced math just to avoid suffering. My strength’s more in brainstorming and product ideas, not code. These days I cheat with AI tools — vibe-coding my way through tiny projects I couldn’t have built alone. If editing PHP templates counts as programming, then I guess I’m doing great.\n\nThe family visit during National Day was… honestly a little dull, but necessary. I wasn’t that close to my family right after university; I think I just needed distance for a while. Lately, I’ve been trying again — maybe the rebellious years finally expired. I don’t go to my mom’s city often, just for big holidays, but it’s nice to see everyone gathered again.\n\nI looked up Matchalabs — looks amazing. At home, drink politics are complicated: three humans and one cat (who, unfortunately, doesn’t get a vote). My boyfriend’s a barista, and our roommate’s a tea purist, so what I drink depends on who’s in the mood to share. I like my drinks cold — always with ice. For coffee, it’s latte or dirty. For tea, I prefer green or floral; cold-brew green tea especially hits the spot. Fermented teas I’ll drink, but they don’t excite me much.\n\nHow’s your week been? Are you still working on that robotic arm project, or has the semester buried you under a pile of other assignments?\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\nLuxy 真的是个完美的名字——她那张“我属于任何地方”的脸庞。我完全可以想象她走进你家的样子，就像她是这里的租客一样。如果我有机会去印尼，我得克制住想把她带走的冲动……或者至少先和你的邻居商量一下探视权。\n\n你那个 UR3 项目真的非常有趣。我以前工作的地方也有一个机械臂，不过我只在旁边看着，从没亲自编程。我们用的界面全是图形化操作，拖拽路径点和点击按钮，而不是写代码。所以你的设置感觉更直接——你简直是在和机器对话。我试着看了你的截图；有些变量名我还是不太懂，但大致能理解。你是不是得根据每个物体调整坐标和夹爪宽度？我想知道 UR3 是否能接收传感器反馈——比如视觉或力反馈——来自我校正。也许这超出了它的能力范围吧。\n\n至于我那段混乱的“工程师”时期……那时我还是个中学生，手里拿着一个假 U 盘，好奇心旺盛。我写了一个小程序，可以让学校电脑上的一个隐藏文件夹自动打开，这样我就可以把文件存放在那里。这个文件夹利用了一个 Explorer 的小漏洞，看起来像一个配置文件——对大多数人来说是看不见的。我还短暂地迷上了 RFID 卡；不知怎么地破解了我们食堂储值卡的系统。幸好在我毕业不久后他们就升级了系统，否则我可能会引发一场全校范围的金融危机。\n\n我并不觉得自己擅长编程——我并不是那种纯粹逻辑思维的人。我甚至选择了一个不需要高级数学的专业，就是为了避免痛苦。我的强项在于头脑风暴和产品创意，而不是代码。现在我用 AI 工具作弊——通过“氛围编程”来完成一些小项目，这些项目我一个人是无法完成的。如果编辑 PHP 模板也算编程的话，那我可能还算不错。\n\n国庆期间的家庭聚会……说实话有点无聊，但也是必要的。大学刚毕业那会儿，我和家人关系并不亲近；我想我只是需要一些距离。最近，我试着重新联系他们——也许叛逆的岁月终于过去了。我很少去妈妈所在的城市，只有在大节日时才会去，但看到大家聚在一起还是挺好的。\n\n我查了一下 Matchalabs——看起来很棒。在家里，饮料的选择很复杂：三个大人和一只猫（不幸的是，猫没有投票权）。我男朋友是个咖啡师，我们的室友是个茶道爱好者，所以我喝什么取决于谁愿意分享。我喜欢冷饮——总是加冰。对于咖啡，我喜欢拿铁或脏咖啡。对于茶，我更喜欢绿茶或花茶；冷泡绿茶尤其让我满意。发酵茶我也喝，但并不特别兴奋。\n\n你这一周过得怎么样？你还在忙那个机械臂项目吗，还是这学期的其他作业已经把你埋在了书堆里？\n\n最好的祝福，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nIt’s amazing how you describe HAM radio — the way you put it makes me appreciate it differently. That kind of independence and direct connection between two people, without relying on modern systems, really does have something pure and timeless about it. It reminds me of when communication used to feel more intentional, like every word carried more weight because of the effort behind it.\n\nReading your letter actually brought back a memory from my childhood — and my cousins used to make paper cup telephones and use them to talk between rooms. It sounds silly now, but at the time, it meant the world to us because we made them ourselves. That simple feeling of connection — even through something so fragile — feels very similar to what you described about radio. There’s something deeply human about creating your own way to reach someone.\n\nIt’s great that you’re studying so deeply for it — the mix of technical and legal work sounds demanding, but I know it’ll be worth it once you make that first contact. There’s something poetic about the idea of voices meeting in the air — invisible, but very real. And I completely agree — there’s something about radio, or even just familiar voices, that makes everything feel a bit more human. It’s the same nostalgia I felt remembering those FM stations back home. Some sounds stay with you forever.\n\nYour train ride back to Nanjing sounds peaceful. There’s always a special calm that comes with watching the world pass by through a train window — it gives you space to think, but also a quiet kind of comfort. And I can imagine Debbie waiting, pretending not to care, but deep down probably missing you the whole time.\n\nLately, I’ve noticed some health concerns. I’m unsure of the exact issue, but I have a doctor's appointment scheduled for Sunday. I’ll update you once I have more information. I’ve decided to pause all activities, hoping it’s nothing serious. I’ll share what I learn after the visit, and I am trying to stay calm and avoid overthinking.\n\nUntil next time, friend,\nMoni",

    "content": "Hi Domino😆\n\nHaha, glad you liked the photos! The white cat's name is Luxy — sounds cute, right? 😄 Though I have to confess, Luxy isn't technically *mine*. She belongs to my neighbor, but I've basically adopted her emotionally at this point. We have this routine where she comes over, I give her pets and treats, and she acts like she owns the place. So yeah, if you try to steal her, you'll have to deal with my neighbor first! 哈哈，小心邻居会生气！But honestly, I totally get it — Luxy is criminally cute. After a long day, hugging her is like instant stress relief 🐱\n\nAbout the robotic arm project — it's actually for a school assignment! We're using a **Universal Robot (UR3)**, which is a pre-built industrial robot arm designed for educational purposes. The task is to program it to pick up objects and stack them into an increasing tower (like in the photos I sent). It's been a really cool learning experience working with a commercial-grade robot rather than building one from scratch with Arduino.\n\nI've attached the full code for how the robot operates! It's mostly about defining pick-and-place routines, coordinate mapping, and making sure the gripper doesn't drop things midway (which happened embarrassingly often during testing 😅). The UR3 uses its own controller system, so the programming is a bit different from standard Arduino setups — more high-level scripting than raw C/C++. Let me know what you think! I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially since you have that Arduino background.\n\nUnfortunately, Slowly doesn't support video uploads, which is a bummer because seeing the robot in action would be way cooler than just reading code 😂 Also yeah, the message delivery times can be brutal sometimes — waiting hours for letters to arrive definitely tests your patience! But I guess that's part of the charm, right?\n\nYour Arduino story is hilarious, by the way! Hiding an ATMEGA32U4 inside a USB stick to automate keyboard/mouse actions? That's some next-level middle-school mischief 😂 Even if you call yourself a \"harmless scriptkid,\" that's genuinely clever. Did you ever get caught, or did you pull it off perfectly? Also, what did you automate? Random typing? Mouse jigglers to prevent screen locks? I'm curious!\n\n你真的没有编程天赋？I doubt that! Building a baby BadUSB takes more than zero talent. Maybe you just haven't found the right project to reignite that spark 😉 Have you done any tech projects since then, or has life taken you in a different direction?\n\nGlad to hear your National Day holiday was relaxing, even if it was a bit boring! Family time is underrated honestly. And wow, a four-hour high-speed train ride sounds exhausting. 腰酸背痛是真的！I can only imagine. Do you travel between your mom's city and Nanjing often, or was this a rare visit?\n\nAbout matcha — I totally get preferring it as a flavor rather than a ceremony! 我也喜欢抹茶味的甜牛奶。Ceremonial matcha can be a bit too earthy/bitter for some people. If you're ever in Indonesia (or can find Indonesian café chains in China), definitely try **Matchalabs**! It's an Indonesian café that sources authentic matcha directly from Japan, and their sea-salt matcha is *chef's kiss* 🤌 The saltiness balances out the bitterness perfectly and adds this interesting savory-sweet combo. They have other creative matcha drinks too. Not sure if they've expanded to China yet, but worth checking!\n\nAlso, I'm curious — do you have a go-to drink order at cafés? Are you more of a coffee person, tea person, or do you bounce between both depending on the mood?\n\nGlad the typhoon didn't hit Nanjing too hard! Cooler air and scattered showers sound manageable. Here in Indonesia, we don't really get typhoons, but we do get intense monsoon rains that can flood entire streets. Different kind of chaos, but equally annoying 😅\n\nAnyway, hope things are settling back into a good rhythm for you in Nanjing! Let me know if you have any questions about the code, or if there's anything tech-related you want to geek out about. Also, if you ever find sea-salt matcha in Nanjing, report back! I'm curious if it tastes the same everywhere or if different cafés add their own twist.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nBest,  \nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino😆\n\n哈哈，很高兴你喜欢那些照片！那只白猫的名字叫Luxy——听起来很可爱，对吧？😄 不过我得坦白，Luxy其实不是我的。她是我的邻居的猫，但我在情感上已经把她当成自己的了。我们有一个固定的模式：她过来，我给她抚摸和零食，她就像这里的主人一样。所以，如果你想要把她带走，可得先过我邻居这一关！哈哈，小心邻居会生气！不过说实话，我完全理解——Luxy实在是太可爱了。忙碌了一天后，抱抱她就像瞬间缓解压力一样🐱\n\n关于那个机械臂项目——其实是学校的作业！我们用的是**Universal Robot (UR3)**，这是一种预先构建的工业机械臂，专为教育目的设计。任务是编程让它拾起物体并堆成一个逐渐增高的塔（就像我发的照片那样）。能够使用商业级别的机器人而不是从零开始用Arduino组装，这是一次非常酷的学习体验。\n\n我已经附上了机器人操作的完整代码！主要是定义拾取和放置的程序、坐标映射，以及确保夹爪不会中途掉落物体（测试时发生过很多次，有点尴尬😅）。UR3有自己的控制系统，所以编程和标准的Arduino设置有点不同——更多的是高级脚本，而不是原始的C/C++。告诉我你的看法吧！尤其是你有Arduino背景，我很想听听你的意见。\n\n可惜Slowly不支持视频上传，这有点遗憾，因为看到机器人在行动肯定比只读代码酷多了😂 而且，有时候消息传递的时间确实很长——等几个小时才收到信确实考验耐心！但我想这也许就是它的魅力所在，对吧？\n\n顺便说一句，你的Arduino故事真的太好笑了！把ATMEGA32U4藏在U盘里自动执行键盘/鼠标操作？这简直是中学恶作剧的高级版😂 即使你自称是“无害的脚本小子”，这确实很聪明。你有没有被抓住过，还是完美地完成了？另外，你都自动化了些什么？随机打字？防止屏幕锁住的鼠标抖动？我很好奇！\n\n你真的没有编程天赋？我可不信！制作一个婴儿版BadUSB可不只是零天赋的事。也许你只是还没找到能重新点燃那份热情的合适项目😉 从那以后你有没有做过其他技术项目，还是生活把你带向了不同的方向？\n\n很高兴听到你的国庆假期很放松，即使有点无聊！说真的，家庭时光被低估了。而且，哇，四个小时的高铁旅程听起来真累。腰酸背痛是真的！我只能想象。你经常在妈妈的城市和南京之间往返，还是这次是难得的探访？\n\n关于抹茶——我完全理解你更喜欢它的味道而不是仪式！我也喜欢抹茶味的甜牛奶。仪式抹茶对一些人来说可能有点太土味/苦味了。如果你有机会来印尼（或者在中国能找到印尼的咖啡连锁店），一定要试试**Matchalabs**！这是一家从日本直接采购正宗抹茶的印尼咖啡馆，他们的海盐抹茶简直是大厨级别的👌 海盐完美地中和了苦味，还增添了独特的咸甜组合。他们还有其他创意的抹茶饮品。不确定他们是否已经扩展到中国，但值得一试！\n\n另外，我很好奇——你在咖啡馆有没有固定的饮品选择？你是咖啡爱好者，茶爱好者，还是根据心情在两者之间切换？\n\n很高兴台风没有对南京造成太大影响！凉爽的空气和零星的阵雨听起来还能应付。在印尼，我们没有台风，但我们会遇到强烈的季风暴雨，整个街道都可能被淹没。不同类型的混乱，但同样令人烦恼😅\n\n总之，希望你在南京的生活重新回到正轨！如果你对代码有任何问题，或者有任何技术相关的话题想讨论，随时告诉我。另外，如果你在南京找到海盐抹茶，记得报告！我想知道它在不同地方的味道是否相同，或者不同的咖啡馆是否有自己的特色。\n\n期待你的回信！\n\n最好的祝福，  \nKel",

    "content": "Hi Kel —\n\nFirst of all, thanks for the photos — your white cat is criminally cute. 那只白猫太可爱了。If I ever make it to Indonesia, 小心我把它偷走，哈哈。\n\nYour robotic arm project looks awesome — feel free to share a short clip when you have time. It also reminded me of my brief Arduino phase back in middle school. I once hid an ATMEGA32U4 in a USB-stick shell to do automatic keyboard/mouse actions on our classroom PCs — basically a baby BadUSB. I was a harmless little scriptkid, thankfully. 我真的没有编程天赋，但那段时间还挺好玩的。\n\nLast week was our National Day holiday, so I spent it in my mom’s city — a little boring, but family time is still worth it. Yesterday I took the four-hour high-speed train back to Nanjing. 腰酸背痛是真的。Now that I’m home, things are settling back into a rhythm.\n\nAbout matcha: for me it’s more of a “flavor” than a ceremony. 我喜欢抹茶味的甜牛奶。Straight ceremonial matcha without anything added is… fine, just not my favorite. Sea-salt matcha sounds intriguing though — if I spot it, I’ll give it a try.\n\nWeather-wise, typhoons mostly brush the coast, but sometimes Nanjing still catches a bit of the fringe — cooler air, some gusts, scattered showers. Nothing too dramatic this time.\n\nBy the way, if you send a snippet of the arm’s code, I’d love to peek. Also, what brand or café makes your favorite sea-salt matcha? I might try to hunt it down here.\n\nBest,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨 Kel — \n\n首先，谢谢你的照片——你的白猫真是太可爱了。如果我有机会去印尼，小心我把它偷走，哈哈。\n\n你的机械臂项目看起来很棒——有时间的话，可以分享一段短片给我看看。这让我想起了中学时短暂的Arduino阶段。我曾经把一个ATMEGA32U4藏在U盘壳里，用来在教室的电脑上自动执行键盘和鼠标操作——基本上就是一个初级的BadUSB。我那时候真是个无害的小黑客，幸好我没有编程天赋，但那段时光还是挺有趣的。\n\n上周是我们的国庆假期，所以我去了妈妈所在的城市——虽然有点无聊，但和家人在一起的时间还是很值得的。昨天我坐了四个小时的高铁回南京，腰酸背痛是真的。现在回到家了，生活又慢慢恢复了节奏。\n\n关于抹茶：对我来说，它更像是一种“味道”而不是仪式。我喜欢抹茶味的甜牛奶。纯正的抹茶不加任何东西的话……还可以，但不是我最喜欢的。不过海盐抹茶听起来挺有趣的——如果我看到的话，我会试试看。\n\n天气方面，台风大多只是掠过海岸，但有时南京还是会受到一些影响——气温会凉一些，有些风，零星的阵雨。这次倒不是很严重。\n\n对了，如果你能发一段机械臂的代码给我，我会很乐意看看。另外，你最喜欢的品牌或咖啡馆的海盐抹茶是哪家？我可能会试着在这里找找看。\n\n最好的祝愿，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nAbout the HAM exam — it’s not really a romantic pursuit for me. What fascinates me is how radio communication works as the most reliable kind of “telephone,” one that doesn’t depend on towers, fiber optics, or anyone else’s infrastructure. It’s pure point-to-point connection. Even when the internet is down, the power grid fails, or you’re somewhere remote, radio still works — as long as two people have the right gear and a bit of knowledge. I think that level of independence is what makes it worth learning.\n\nSo lately, I’ve been spending most of my nights reviewing frequency bands, power limits, and all the regulations that go with them. The technical side is manageable, but the legal part feels endless. Still, it’s good to know what you’re doing before pressing that button. If all goes well, maybe I’ll be able to make my first real contact soon — that’ll be the real reward.\n\nYour story about the Nile and those old FM stations keeps coming back to me. There’s something universal about radio — even now, when everything’s digital, it still carries a human kind of simplicity. Just two signals meeting in the air.\n\nNanjing’s weather has finally cooled down. The sunlight looks softer, the air feels lighter, and people seem to slow down a little — it’s a welcome change after the long summer.\n\nI’m writing this on the high-speed train back to Nanjing, watching the fields slide past the window. I’m tired, but in a good way — that quiet kind of fatigue that only travel brings. Mostly, I’m just thinking about getting home. I can already picture Debbie waiting by the door, pretending not to care that I was gone. I can’t wait to see him.\n\nTake care,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n关于HAM考试——对我来说，这并不是一种浪漫的追求。真正吸引我的是无线电通信作为最可靠的“电话”方式，它不依赖于基站、光纤或任何其他基础设施。这是一种纯粹的点对点连接。即使互联网中断，电网故障，或者你身处偏远地区，无线电依然可以工作——只要两个人拥有合适的设备和一些知识。我认为这种独立性使它值得学习。\n\n所以最近，我大部分的夜晚都在复习频段、功率限制以及所有相关的法规。技术方面还好处理，但法律部分感觉永无止境。不过，在按下那个按钮之前，了解自己在做什么总是好的。如果一切顺利，也许我很快就能进行第一次真正的联系——那将是最真实的回报。\n\n你提到尼罗河和那些老FM电台的故事一直在我脑海中回荡。无线电有一种普遍性——即使在今天，一切都数字化了，它仍然保留着一种人性的简单。仅仅是两个信号在空中相遇。\n\n南京的天气终于凉快了。阳光变得柔和，空气也变得轻盈，人们似乎也放慢了脚步——这是漫长的夏天之后一个令人愉悦的变化。\n\n我正在高铁上写这封信，看着窗外的田野缓缓掠过。我感到疲惫，但是一种好的疲惫——只有旅行才能带来的那种宁静的疲惫。我最想的还是回家。我已经想象到黛比在门口等着我，假装不在乎我离开了。我迫不及待想见到他。\n\n保重，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hi Domino😆\n\nI'm so relieved to hear you finally got some proper rest! Sleep deprivation is no joke, especially when you're working on something important like that jewelry exhibition. \n\nAbout the typhoon — interesting that you barely felt it in Nanjing since it stayed on the coast. Here in Batam, we have a similar weather pattern. 每年快到新年的时候经常下雨 (It often rains heavily when approaching the New Year). It happens almost like clockwork every year!\n\nAnd yes, fellow matcha lover! 🍵 My favorites are pure ceremonial grade matcha and sea salt matcha. There's something about the quality of ceremonial grade that just hits different, and the sea salt version gives that perfect sweet-salty balance. What's your go-to matcha drink?\n\nAbout the robotic arm — yes, that's actually from my coursework! It's a university project where we have to code the logic first before the machine can move. I'll send you some of the code so you can see what it looks like. And hey, if you're interested in Arduino, 我可以教你 (I can teach you)! Hahaha, though I have to admit 我还是初学者 (I'm still a beginner myself). But that's the fun part, right? We can learn together!\n\nNow, about Debbie — 太可爱了! (So adorable!) The name story is hilarious, and honestly, that slightly derpy expression makes him even more lovable. 我想偷你的猫 (I want to steal your cat) hahaha! He looks so content in those photos.\n\nSpeaking of cats, I'm so sorry I forgot to send pictures of mine earlier! Here's the thing — I actually have cats back at my family home, but I'm currently away for university. There's this one particular cat who's incredibly attached to me. 每次我放假回家，他总是在门口等我 (Every time I come home from university, he always waits for me at the gate). It's one of the sweetest things — no matter how long I've been away, he's always there. I'll make sure to send you photos next time I'm home!\n\nHow's everything going now that you're back in Nanjing? Did the typhoon delay your flight, or did you make it back smoothly?\n\nBest,\nKel",

    "content": "Dear Dominoh,\n\nYour holiday sounds like the perfect mix of adventure and calm. I could almost picture you walking along the ancient city wall — it must’ve been quite a sight, even if the light show didn’t live up to the hype. Sometimes those overly crowded events lose their charm fast, and the quiet moments afterward end up feeling far more special. Resting in a hotel room after a long day out can be its own kind of peace — I know exactly what you mean.\n\nThat HAM radio project sounds really fascinating! There’s something nostalgic about it — almost like reaching back to the early days of human connection before everything turned digital. The way you described listening to distant signals reminded me of how magical it feels to tune into shortwave frequencies or even old static-filled broadcasts. It’s incredible that sound can travel so far through the air, carrying pieces of life from people you’ve never met. By the way, I realized I don’t really know what exactly does the HAM radio exam means. How does it work?\n\nTalking about radio actually reminded me of something from my childhood. I really wish I could go back to Sudan just to listen to Radio 4th and 24 FM. We used to listen to them on our way back home from my grandma’s house, driving along quiet roads lit by those warm orange lights, passing beside the Nile. It was such a peaceful feeling — pure nostalgia for me. Don’t get me wrong, Egypt has its charm, but Sudan’s Nile will always hold a special place in my heart, haha.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that the question bank doubled right when you decided to take the exam, but I have no doubt you’ll pass it. You’ve got that steady, patient kind of determination — the kind that doesn’t rush but always gets there. Once you finally transmit your first message, it’ll make all the effort feel worth it.\n\nAs for me, things have been pretty calm too. I’ve been keeping consistent with the gym and focusing on work. My new team leader is really nice, though sometimes a bit unsure of what she’s doing — it gives off this feeling of uncertainty. Still, she’s a genuinely decent person, and I’m willing to roll with that for now. It’s kind of amazing how simple things like manners and respectful behavior can have such an impact in this world — almost poetic, if you think about it.\n\nUntil next time,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n你的假期听起来像是冒险与宁静的完美结合。我几乎能想象你沿着古城墙漫步的样子——即使灯光秀没有达到预期的效果，那也一定是一番壮观的景象。有时候，那些过于拥挤的活动很快就会失去魅力，而之后的宁静时刻反而显得更加特别。在忙碌的一天后，回到酒店房间休息，也是一种独特的宁静——我完全明白你的感受。\n\n那个HAM无线电项目听起来真的很有趣！它有一种怀旧的感觉——仿佛回到了人类早期的交流方式，那时候一切都还没有数字化。你描述的聆听远方信号的方式让我想起了调频短波或老旧的静电广播时的那种魔幻感觉。声音能通过空气传播这么远，传递着来自你从未见过的人的生活片段，这真是令人难以置信。对了，我意识到我并不太了解HAM无线电考试的具体内容。它是怎么进行的呢？\n\n说到无线电，这让我想起了童年的某件事。我真希望我能回到苏丹，只是为了听4台和24台的广播。我们以前在从奶奶家回来的路上，开车经过那些温暖的橙色灯光照亮的安静道路，旁边就是尼罗河。那是一种非常平静的感觉——对我来说纯粹是怀旧。别误会，埃及也有它的魅力，但苏丹的尼罗河将永远在我心中占据特殊的位置，哈哈。\n\n很遗憾，当你决定参加考试时，题库竟然翻了一倍，但我毫不怀疑你会通过。你有一种稳重而耐心的决心——那种不急不躁但总能达成目标的决心。一旦你成功发送了第一条信息，所有的努力都会变得值得。\n\n至于我，生活也相当平静。我一直在坚持去健身房，并专注于工作。我的新团队领导人很好，虽然有时候她对自己的工作有些不确定——这给人一种不确定的感觉。不过，她确实是一个真诚的好人，我愿意暂时接受这种状态。想想看，像礼貌和尊重这样的简单行为在这个世界上竟然能产生如此大的影响——这几乎是一种诗意的存在。\n\n下次再聊，\n莫妮",

Yes, that photo was from my new motorcycle license — the official one. Funny thing is, it’s actually one of the very few ID photos I think turned out okay. It was taken a few years ago when I got my car license. I printed way too many copies back then and never used them all — who knew one of them would end up on my second license years later?\n\nCongratulations on your new job! 🥳 I can totally understand that mixed feeling. It’s not always easy to tell whether to feel proud or just relieved, especially when the job isn’t exactly what you dreamed of. But still, after two years, getting back into work is a big step — and having it at your father’s old workplace makes it even more meaningful somehow. I really hope your colleagues turn out to be kind people, and that the salary gives you some breathing room.\n\nAnd Yoshi — oh my god, he was adorable as a kitten 😭.  I’m really happy he’s doing better now; I can see he’s loved and well cared for.\nBy the way, what does “Yoshi” mean? Is it from one of the Malian languages, or does it come from somewhere else? I’ve been curious since I first heard his name.\n\nAs for me, this week marks China’s National Day — the first week of October is our longest holiday apart from the Lunar New Year. The whole country basically turns into a massive migration, with people rushing from their hometowns to other cities to travel. I’m actually on the road right now too — heading to my mom’s city for a few days. She’s been staying there with my aunt, helping take care of my two little nieces. This National Day will be a small family reunion — my mom and her sisters, three families all together again.\n\nTell Yoshi his fan from China says hi 😸\nAnd good luck with your first days at work — I really hope everything goes smoothly.\n\nTake care,\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nMy holiday has been fairly relaxing overall. Except for the first day — I walked several kilometers to visit an ancient city wall and ended up watching a crowded but rather boring light show. The quality didn’t really make up for the chaos, so I decided that would be my last “tourist experience” for the week. After that, I’ve had much more freedom. No more big family outings, no schedules to follow — just me spending quiet time resting in the hotel room, which honestly felt perfect.\n\nThese past two days, I’ve started preparing for my HAM radio exam. I bought a handheld transceiver a while ago, but since I don’t have a license yet, I can only listen, not transmit. So I finally decided to take the exam and make it official. The bad news is, starting this October, the exam questions have doubled in volume — apparently, they’ve updated the entire question bank. Guess I picked the wrong year to apply 😅. Still, I’m determined to pass; it’s just going to take a bit more effort than I expected.\n\nThere’s something oddly charming about learning radio operation — it feels like reconnecting with an older, more technical world, where communication still carried a bit of magic. Even just listening to random signals or distant conversations makes me feel strangely grounded. Maybe it’s the idea of voices traveling through invisible airwaves that fascinates me.\n\nAnyway, that’s my little update for now. Nothing dramatic, just quiet days filled with studying, static noise, and instant coffee. Hopefully, next time I’ll be able to tell you I passed the exam and can finally transmit for real.\n\nUntil next time,\nDomino",

I can imagine how busy China must get during National Day — everyone rushing to travel or reunite with their families.

Having a plug-in hybrid already gives you the best of both worlds. That kind of flexibility sounds perfect for your lifestyle.\n\nAbout Blue Lock — I can see why you’d hear about it a lot; it’s definitely been making waves lately. I finished it not long ago, and it really stuck with me. It’s fast-paced, but what I liked most was how it explores ambition and individuality — it’s more psychological than I expected.

The prices weren’t bad at all, but honestly, I haven’t run into any situation where I had to ride. For now, I think I’ll just stick with my car. Since it’s a plug-in hybrid, charging is cheap enough and still feels practical.\n\nThe weather in Nanjing has been really pleasant these past few days, but the crowds are starting to build. The first week of October is our National Day holiday — it’s the longest break of the year after Chinese New Year, and it feels like the whole country is on the move, traveling from their own cities to others. I’m already on my way out too, heading to the city where my mom lives. She’s been staying with one of her sisters (my aunt) to help take care of my two nieces. This holiday will be a rare chance for three of my mom’s sisters’ families to gather together, so it should be nice.\n\nSo your movie photos were taken at home? That actually sounds great — I realize I haven’t had a proper “movie night” at home in ages. Maybe when I get back after the holiday, I’ll suggest it to my roommates.\n\nAs for Blue Lock, I haven’t watched it myself yet, though I’ve definitely heard of it. A lot of my friends have been following it. Lately I find it hard to sit still for anime — maybe my mindset has been a bit restless.\n\nYour Fitbit sounds useful! I’ve been debating whether to switch my Apple Watch for a Xiaomi band. Ever since I bought a new Android phone earlier this year, my iPhone has only been a backup, which means my Apple Watch lost its notification function (it can’t connect to my main phone). It’s frustrating. I don’t want to give up some of the Apple Watch features, but I also can’t wear two devices on my wrist.\n\nWhen it comes to self-study, I think just keeping up the habit is already a big achievement. You don’t need to rush. Honestly, I admire your consistency and drive. My boyfriend and I once tried a Duolingo streak challenge, but after a while it faded out. That’s why I really respect your persistence.\n\nAnd haha, I’m glad you liked that photo of me. It was actually taken years ago when I got my car license. They printed more than one copy back then, and I kept it. Funny that it came in handy again now.\n\nUntil next time,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n关于摩托车——我最近确实去看了几辆踏板车。价格其实还不错，但老实说，我还没有遇到非骑不可的情况。目前，我还是打算继续用我的车。因为它是一款插电式混合动力车，充电费用相当便宜，而且使用起来也很方便。\n\n南京最近的天气非常好，不过人流量开始增加。十月初是我们的国庆假期——这是继春节之后最长的假期，感觉整个国家都在移动，人们从自己的城市前往其他城市。我也准备出发，去我妈妈住的城市。她最近一直在她姐姐（我的姨妈）家帮忙照顾我的两个侄女。这个假期将是妈妈的三个姐妹家庭难得的团聚机会，所以应该会很愉快。\n\n你的电影照片是在家里拍的吗？这听起来真不错——我意识到自己已经很久没有在家里好好地度过一个“电影之夜”了。等假期回来后，我打算向我的室友提议一下。\n\n至于《蓝色监狱》，我自己还没有看过，不过我确实听说过。我的很多朋友都在追这部。最近我发现很难静下心来看动漫——可能我的心态有点浮躁。\n\n你的Fitbit听起来很实用！我一直在考虑是否要把我的Apple Watch换成小米手环。自从今年年初换了新的安卓手机后，我的iPhone就只能作为备用机，这意味着我的Apple Watch失去了通知功能（无法与我的主手机连接）。这让我很沮丧。我既不想放弃Apple Watch的一些功能，又不想在手腕上戴两个设备。\n\n说到自学，我觉得能够坚持这个习惯本身就是一种很大的成就。你不需要急躁。老实说，我非常钦佩你的坚持和动力。我和男朋友曾经尝试过一个Duolingo连续打卡挑战，但后来渐渐放弃了。这就是为什么我真的很佩服你的坚持。\n\n哈哈，很高兴你喜欢那张我的照片。那其实是几年前我拿到驾照时拍的。当时他们打印了多份，我就留了下来。真有趣，现在又派上了用场。\n\n下次再聊，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Dominoh,\n\nCongratulations on passing your motorcycle test! 🎉 That must’ve felt like such a relief after the first attempt. I know what you mean about it being a new kind of freedom — even if you don’t get a bike right away, just knowing you’ve unlocked that skill is powerful. It’s like having an extra key in your pocket for the future. Do you have any idea what type of bike you’d want to get someday, or is it just a “maybe later” thought for now?\n\nI can picture Nanjing’s weather shift — autumn always brings a new atmosphere, doesn’t it? That cool, crisp air feels refreshing after months of heat. Egypt is still warm, but I’m noticing the small signs of change here too. There’s something comforting about that transition, almost like the world is finally slowing down a little.\n\nAnd about those cinema photos — actually, I watched the film at home with my friends. It wasn’t the same as going to the theater, but it had its own charm. There’s something nice about gathering together, sharing snacks, and reacting to the story in real time with people close to you. Sometimes those small moments feel just as memorable as the big experiences.\n\nAs for my side, I’ve recently finished the Blue Lock series — it was intense and gave me a lot to think about regarding teamwork and ambition. I’ve also been keeping up with the gym, building consistency again, and it feels rewarding to see slow progress. I even picked up a new Fitbit to help me stay on track — it keeps me mindful about drinking water, sticking to my diet, and pushing myself a little more at the gym. Small tools like that make the routine feel easier to stick with.\n\nOn the academic front, I’m preparing for university while still working on my French. I’m still taking baby steps with it, but I’m trying to speed up as much as I can while making sure I have a strong grammar foundation first. It feels like a slow process, but I know that solid groundwork will pay off once I get deeper into the language.\n\nI really enjoy reading your updates, Dominoh. They always carry a calm but genuine energy that makes me look forward to writing back. I’m glad we’ve kept up this exchange.\n\nUntil next time, friend,\nMoni\n\nP.S. Honestly, your license photo turned out solid — you look like yourself, confident and ready. A lot of people get unlucky with those photos, but yours came out great.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Dominoh，\n\n恭喜你通过了摩托车考试！🎉 经过第一次尝试后的这次成功一定让你松了一口气吧。我明白你的意思，这确实是一种新的自由——即使你现在还没有马上买摩托车，但知道你已经掌握了这项技能，感觉真的很棒。这就像你口袋里多了一把钥匙，为未来准备着。你有没有想过将来想买什么样的摩托车，还是说这只是“以后再说”的想法？\n\n我能想象南京的天气变化——秋天总是带来一种新的氛围，不是吗？在经历了几个月的炎热之后，那凉爽清新的空气让人感觉格外舒畅。埃及这里仍然很暖和，但我也能感受到一些变化的迹象。这种过渡让人感到一种安慰，仿佛世界终于放慢了脚步。\n\n关于那些电影院的照片——其实，我和朋友们在家里看了这部电影。虽然没有去电影院的感觉，但也有它独特的魅力。聚在一起，分享零食，实时地对故事做出反应，这些小时刻有时和大体验一样令人难忘。\n\n至于我这边，我最近刚看完《蓝色监狱》系列——它非常紧张，让我对团队合作和雄心壮志有了很多思考。我也一直在坚持去健身房，重新建立起一致性，看到缓慢的进步感觉非常有成就感。我还买了一个新的Fitbit来帮助我保持进度——它让我更加注意喝水、坚持饮食和在健身房多努力一点。这些小工具让日常习惯更容易坚持下去。\n\n在学术方面，我正在为大学做准备，同时还在学习法语。我还在慢慢来，但尽量加快速度，同时确保先打下坚实的语法基础。虽然感觉进展缓慢，但我知道坚实的根基会在深入学习语言时带来回报。\n\n我真的很喜欢读你的更新，Dominoh。它们总是带着一种平静而真诚的能量，让我期待回信。很高兴我们能保持这种交流。\n\n下次再聊，朋友，\nMoni\n\n附：说实话，你的驾照照片拍得很好——你看起来很自信，准备好了。很多人都拍不出好照片，但你的照片真的很棒。",

I wouldn’t say I plan to get a bike anytime soon, but having the skill feels like unlocking a small new freedom. The exam day itself was less stressful than I expected once I got into the rhythm, and now I’m just relieved it’s done.\n\nMeanwhile, the weather in Nanjing has really shifted. Just a week ago it was still that unbearable “autumn tiger” heat, but now the air feels noticeably cooler. I can finally go without the AC, and it makes everything more comfortable. It feels like autumn has truly arrived at last.\n\nBy the way, I saw the cinema photos you sent — they looked interesting! Was that from the film you mentioned in your earlier letter?

And… a funny discovery: whenever I spend a lot of money in one day, I somehow end up with a headache. I’m not sure if it’s just coincidence or some kind of strange superstition at work 😅.\n\nSpeaking of motorcycles, I have good news — this afternoon I finally got my new license! Yayyyy 🎉 (Though to be fair, I had to pay a lot again to join a special training course at the test center’s driving school.) \n\nFor now I don’t actually plan to ride a motorcycle regularly, but at least I can legally be on the road now.\n\n\nYour Independence Day celebration looked wonderful!

And I think Arduino projects are super cool — though I have to admit 我没有编程天赋 (I don’t really have programming talent). By the way, was that robotic arm in your photo part of your project?

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nNo need to apologize for the delay — life gets busy, and honestly, I enjoy receiving your messages whenever they arrive. They always feel worth the wait, and it’s nice to have something thoughtful to read and respond to.\n\nYour thoughts on RDR2 really make me curious about it. I actually plan to play it once I get a PS5 — I’ve been saving it for that moment so I can experience it properly with the best performance. That’s why I thought about tackling the first game in the meantime, just to get a sense of the story and background before diving into the sequel. I know the controls and feel might be different, but it seemed like a good way to prepare myself for the full experience later on. The way you describe Rockstar’s world-building and writing convinces me even more that the wait will be worth it.\n\nSpeaking of Rockstar, I actually finished the whole GTA series earlier this year. GTA V was the last one I wrapped up — I know, playing GTA V for the first time in the big 2025 sounds late, but better late than never! It really was a true immersive experience, with how alive the world felt and how naturally the story pulled me in. But if I had to pick an absolute favorite, it would still be GTA San Andreas. Something about its atmosphere, freedom, and characters just made it unforgettable for me. I really hope GTA VI manages to surpass it — if anyone can pull that off, it’s Rockstar.\n\nI hadn’t heard of Disco Elysium before you mentioned it, but I’ll definitely look into it. The way you describe it makes it sound like one of those rare games where the writing and choices matter even more than the visuals, and I find that idea really interesting. It’s always exciting to discover something new through a recommendation.\n\nThe Martian was a great rewatch choice. It’s one of those films that reminds you of how resilient humans can be, even when everything is against them. I share your love for hard sci-fi — the type that makes you feel like you’re learning and imagining at the same time. I haven’t read Dead on Mars yet, but the setup sounds like something I’d enjoy, even if the ending isn’t perfect. And yes, I’ve definitely heard of The Three-Body Problem. That story feels like it operates on a completely different scale, almost overwhelming with the ideas it introduces.\n\nI’m glad you mentioned your motorcycle test — that’s exciting! I like that you’re taking the time to walk the grounds and familiarize yourself with the test center beforehand. That kind of preparation shows real determination, and I think it’ll make a big difference. Riding a motorcycle must feel like freedom in a way driving a car can’t quite capture. I’ll be rooting for you to pass this time, and I hope your practice pays off. Definitely let me know how it turns out — I’ll be looking forward to some good news.\n\nYour National Day holiday plans sound really meaningful. Taking the high-speed train is a great choice — not just because it’s easier, but because there’s something relaxing about trains, where you can sit back, watch the scenery, and let time pass quietly. Visiting your mom and relatives will no doubt be refreshing, especially if it’s been a while. Reconnecting with family always feels grounding, and I’m sure it’ll be special for your mom too.\n\nThank you again for sharing so much, Domino. It’s always nice to read about your thoughts on games, films, books, and even your daily life. It makes your letters feel alive, like I’m getting a glimpse into both your interests and your routines. I’ll be waiting to hear from you again — hopefully with great news about your motorcycle test and maybe even stories from your holiday trip.\n\nUntil next time,\nMoni\n\nPS: Here are the pics I promised you last time. You’ve sent me a lot of meaningful photos, and I’ll try to do the same in return from now on.",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nI kept forgetting to log in these past two days — finally remembered to reply today, so apologies for the delay.\n\nAbout Red Dead Redemption — I’ve only played the second one. After spending so much time in RDR2, it feels strange to go back to the first game, even the remastered version. The controls just don’t feel the same, so I never stuck with it. But RDR2? I’ve finished the story more than once. Rockstar really put so much care into it — the world-building, the writing, the attention to detail. They’re a company with real ambition. I’ve also enjoyed the GTA series for the same reason: their stories are always layered, sometimes absurd, but strangely human too. If you haven’t played RDR2 yet, you absolutely should — it’s an experience worth having.\n\nWhen it comes to games, my interests usually split in two directions: stunning visuals (like the Forza Horizon racing series) and captivating stories. If the narrative is strong enough, I don’t mind if the graphics aren’t perfect. Disco Elysium is a good example — it’s not about photorealism, but the art style and writing draw you in completely.\n\nSpeaking of stories, I rewatched The Martian yesterday. I’ve always had a soft spot for hard sci-fi — the kind that feels grounded in real science but still leaves you wide-eyed. In China, there’s actually a novella with a very similar premise called Dead on Mars. The ending isn’t perfect, but I loved the setup. And of course, Liu Cixin’s Three-Body Problem — maybe you’ve heard of it? That one is on a whole different scale.\n\nOn the real-life front: I’ve scheduled my motorcycle test again — it’s in two days. Tomorrow I’m planning to visit the test center, walk the grounds, maybe even pay for a short practice run if they allow it. Hopefully this time I’ll have better luck.\n\nAnd one more thing: the first week of October is our National Day holiday here. I’m planning to take a high-speed train (not driving this time) to the city where my mom lives, to spend some time with her and my relatives. It’ll be good to reconnect — it’s been a while.\n\nUntil next time,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n这两天我一直忘记登录——终于想起来回复你了，所以对于延迟回复表示歉意。\n\n关于《荒野大镖客》——我只玩过第二部。在《荒野大镖客2》里花了那么多时间后，再回到第一部，即使是重制版，也感觉很奇怪。操作方式完全不同，所以我一直没能坚持玩下去。但《荒野大镖客2》？我已经多次通关了。R星公司真的投入了极大的心血——世界观的构建、剧本的编写、细节的处理。他们是一家有真正雄心的公司。我也因为同样的原因喜欢《侠盗猎车手》系列：他们的故事总是层次丰富，有时荒诞，但又出奇地贴近人性。如果你还没玩过《荒野大镖客2》，你绝对应该试试——那是一段值得体验的旅程。\n\n说到游戏，我的兴趣通常分为两个方向：令人惊叹的视觉效果（比如《极限竞速：地平线》系列）和引人入胜的故事。如果故事足够吸引人，我并不介意画面是否完美。《极乐迪斯科》就是一个很好的例子——它不追求照片级的真实感，但艺术风格和剧本完全能吸引你。\n\n说到故事，我昨天重温了《火星救援》。我一直对硬科幻情有独钟——那种既基于真实科学又令人目瞪口呆的作品。在中国，有一部短篇小说《火星上的最后一天》与之非常相似。虽然结局并不完美，但我非常喜欢它的设定。当然，还有刘慈欣的《三体》——也许你听说过？那是一部完全不同的作品。\n\n现实生活方面：我已经重新安排了摩托车考试——就在两天后。明天我计划去考试中心，熟悉场地，如果允许的话，也许还会付费进行一次短暂的练习。希望这次能顺利通过。\n\n还有一件事：十月份的第一周是中国的国庆假期。我计划乘坐高铁（这次不开车）去我妈妈所在的城市，和她及亲戚们共度时光。重新联系一下会很好——已经很久没见了。\n\n下次再聊，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nI can imagine how exhausting the past couple of days must have been for you. Getting back to Nanjing early in the morning, after only about seven hours of sleep over two nights, already sounds like a challenge on its own. And then jumping straight into driving your boyfriend and your roommate to work, followed by your own meetings — that’s a lot to handle all at once. I can picture the mix of emotions you described: that initial burst of manic energy, feeling like you could take on anything, followed by complete exhaustion, and finally that strange state where your mind is alert and active but your body is already drained. It’s such a familiar, almost surreal rhythm — one of those days where every moment feels both overwhelming and oddly exhilarating.\n\nI can relate in a way, even from my own routine — there are times when your brain is racing ahead with everything you want to do, but your body is begging for rest, and you have to somehow keep moving. It sounds like you managed it with a lot of focus, though, which is impressive. I hope you’ve been able to give yourself a small break and recharge a little, even if it’s just a quiet moment to breathe and let the day sink in.\n\nOn a lighter note, I recently finished Red Dead Redemption 1 for the first time, and I can’t stop thinking about it. The story, the open world, the characters — it all felt so immersive and alive. From riding across the plains to exploring towns and interacting with random strangers in the game, every little detail made the world feel like it had its own heartbeat. I’d love to hear if you like to play video games and, if so, whether you have a favorite series. It’s fascinating how games can give you both adventure and reflection at the same time.\n\nLately, I’ve been noticing how the small, seemingly ordinary moments are often the most memorable. Whether it’s enjoying a quiet meal, going for a walk, hearing a song that resonates, or just laughing with friends, these little sparks make life richer. It’s amazing how much they add up, even on days that feel exhausting or chaotic. I feel like those are the moments that really stay with you.\n\nYesterday, my sister and I had some friends over, and it was a really fun, low-key day. My friend AJ had just bought a new PS5, so we spent some time playing Astro Bot — it was surprisingly fun and totally addictive. Later, we decided to watch a movie together. The options were Society of the Snow or Entergalactic, and the majority voted for Entergalactic. It was entertaining enough, though not a movie I’ll remember forever. But honestly, the laughter and conversations with everyone made the evening really special. It reminded me that sometimes the people you’re with make a moment more memorable than the activity itself.\n\nI hope your workload calms down soon and that you find a little time to recharge, whether that’s with a quiet cup of coffee, a short walk, or even just a few minutes to yourself. I always enjoy reading your letters, rough edges and all — your honesty makes them fascinating, and they really feel like glimpses into your world.\n\nWarmest regards, friend,\nMoni\n\nP.S. That photo you sent of you walking down the plane’s hallway with all those people around really made me smile. I’m guessing that was your flight home? There’s something so candid and alive about it — it almost feels like I was there with you for a moment.\n\nP.S. 2: I wanted to send you a picture from when we watched the movie, but I couldn’t find it. I’ll make sure to include it in my next letter",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n我能想象过去的几天对你来说是多么的疲惫。凌晨回到南京，两个晚上只睡了大约七个小时，这本身就已经是一个挑战了。然后你紧接着开车送男朋友和室友去上班，接着又参加自己的会议——这一切都是一次不小的考验。我能想象你描述的那些情绪：最初那股狂热的能量，感觉自己无所不能，随后是彻底的疲惫，最后进入一种奇怪的状态，头脑依然清醒活跃，但身体已经疲惫不堪。这是一种熟悉而又几乎超现实的节奏——那些时刻既让人感到压力重重，又令人兴奋不已。\n\n我也有过类似的经历，即使是在自己的日常生活中——有时候大脑在飞快地思考着所有想做的事情，但身体却在恳求休息，你不得不继续前行。不过听你描述，你似乎凭借极大的专注度应对了一切，这真的很令人佩服。希望你能给自己一些休息的时间，哪怕只是片刻的宁静，深呼吸，让这一天慢慢沉淀下来。\n\n轻松一点的话题，我最近第一次玩完了《荒野大镖客1》，我简直无法停止思考它。故事情节、开放世界、角色——一切都如此沉浸和生动。无论是骑马穿越平原，探索城镇，还是与游戏中的路人互动，每一个细节都让这个世界仿佛有了自己的心跳。我很想知道你是否喜欢玩电子游戏，如果有，你最喜欢哪个系列？游戏的魅力在于它能同时给你带来冒险和思考。\n\n最近，我注意到那些看似平凡的小瞬间往往是记忆中最深刻的。无论是享受一顿安静的餐点，去散步，听到一首共鸣的歌曲，还是和朋友大笑，这些小小的火花让生活更加丰富。令人惊讶的是，即使在那些疲惫或混乱的日子里，这些瞬间也能积累成美好的回忆。我觉得这些才是真正留在你心中的时刻。\n\n昨天，我和姐姐邀请了一些朋友来家里，度过了一个非常有趣而轻松的一天。我的朋友AJ刚买了一台新的PS5，所以我们花了一些时间玩《Astro Bot》——这游戏出乎意料地有趣，而且非常上瘾。后来，我们决定一起看电影。选择是《雪国列车》或《星际奇缘》，大多数人投票选择了《星际奇缘》。虽然这部电影并不算特别难忘，但和朋友们的笑声和交谈让这个晚上变得特别有意义。这让我意识到，有时候，和你在一起的人比活动本身更能让你记住一个时刻。\n\n希望你的工作压力能尽快减轻，也希望你能找到一些时间来充电，无论是安静地喝一杯咖啡，散散步，或者仅仅是给自己几分钟的时间。我总是喜欢读你的信，即使有些粗糙的地方——你的真诚让这些信变得非常吸引人，仿佛让我看到了你生活中的片段。\n\n最温暖的问候，朋友，\nMoni\n\n附言：你发的那张在飞机走廊里走的照片，周围都是人，真的让我笑了。我猜那是你回家的航班吧？那张照片如此真实而生动，仿佛我也在你身边度过了那一刻。\n\n附言2：我想发一张我们一起看电影的照片，但没能找到。我会在下一封信中附上。",

I was worried you meant the city was actually chaotic, but workload chaos makes much more sense. \n\nI'm genuinely concerned about your sleep situation though - not getting much sleep while dealing with such an important project sounds really tough on your body. 请多保重身体 (Please take care of your health). Even when work is demanding, try to find moments to rest when you can.\n\nThe jewelry industry challenge sounds difficult when it's not your passion. You're right that adapting to that environment is key - finding ways to make your daily work there more enjoyable, even if the high price tags feel intimidating. 我走一步看一步 is probably the wisest approach for now.\n\nThe two sides of freelancing you described really resonates. That constant balance between freedom and pressure, especially 没有坐班的工作, must create this ongoing tension. Both the liberation and the weight of being entirely responsible for your own success.\n\nAbout Hong Kong - I think you're right that social media shows the glamorous side. The reality you're describing with older infrastructure and constant pressure sounds much different from the polished images we usually see online. It's interesting how repeated visits reveal those less glamorous layers.\n\nI'm currently learning about open-source projects and AI tools like you suggested. 希望我能快速适应并开始提供服务 (I hope I can adapt quickly and start offering my services). The programming path feels both exciting and daunting.\n\nAs for my Chinese - 我觉得还有很多错误的用法哈哈哈 (I think there are still many incorrect usages hahaha). Your patience in mixing Chinese into these letters really helps with practice though.\n\nThe typhoon situation sounds stressful. 希望不会影响你的航班 (Hope it won't affect your flight). Safe travels back to the mainland.\n\nAbout my overlapping storylines - honestly, I'm still pretty confused about how they all fit together. The whole juggling act of studying robotics while wanting to program, learning Chinese while being in Indonesia, and trying to figure out my future direction hasn't gotten much clearer yet.\n\nBest,\nKel",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Domino😉\n\n谢谢你的澄清！我原本担心你说的是城市混乱，但工作量的混乱确实更有道理。\n\n不过，我确实很担心你的睡眠状况——在处理这样一个重要的项目时睡眠不足，对身体确实是个挑战。请多保重身体。即使工作再繁忙，也要尽量找时间休息。\n\n你说的珠宝行业挑战确实不容易，尤其是当你对它没有热情的时候。你提到适应那个环境是关键——找到方法让你的日常工作更愉快，即使高价标签让你感到有些 intimidat­ing。我走一步看一步可能是现在最明智的做法。\n\n你描述的自由职业的两面性真的很能引起共鸣。那种自由与压力之间的平衡，尤其是没有坐班的工作，确实会带来持续的紧张感。既是解放，也是完全负责自己成功的重担。\n\n关于香港——我觉得你说得对，社交媒体展示的往往是光鲜的一面。你描述的老旧基础设施和持续的压力，与我们通常在网上看到的精致画面大相径庭。有趣的是，多次访问确实能揭示那些不那么光鲜的层面。\n\n我目前正在学习你建议的开源项目和AI工具。希望我能快速适应并开始提供服务。编程这条路既令人兴奋又让人感到挑战。\n\n至于我的中文——我觉得还有很多错误的用法哈哈哈。你在信中耐心地混入中文真的对我练习很有帮助。\n\n台风的情况听起来很紧张。希望不会影响你的航班。祝你回大陆旅途平安。\n\n关于我那些交织的故事线——老实说，我仍然不太清楚它们是如何联系在一起的。一边学习机器人技术，一边想编程，一边在印尼学习中文，一边试图弄清楚未来的方向，这一切还没有变得清晰。\n\n祝好，\nKel",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nNo worries at all about the late reply — Hong Kong sounds like the perfect excuse 😅. I can only imagine the whirlwind of neon lights, crowded streets, and sudden bursts of energy that the city throws at you. It must’ve been chaotic in the best way possible. I’m curious, though — did you manage to sneak in a moment for street food, or was it all business and rushing around?\n\nYour story about spoiling yourself with computer parts was very relatable. I think everyone has their own “indulgence loophole.” Yours was tech for work back in the day and now has shifted to dining out, while mine happens to be new gadgets, gym clothes, and self-care products — though I know it’ll eventually shift to something else too. When people ask me about it, I usually say it’s an improvement to oneself — or at least that’s how I view it. In a way, we’re not that different: you were investing in computer parts to keep creating, while I’m investing in myself to keep improving.\n\nAs for Interstellar… that was actually my very first time watching it — and to see it on the big screen made it all the more unforgettable. Nolan just has a way of bending both time and emotion until you feel completely small and yet infinite at once. I love how you’ve rewatched it so many times, and I get why — it really feels like one of those films that would reveal something new each time. What’s your second-favorite Nolan film, if you had to choose?\n\nLately, I’ve found myself drawn back into my old interest in aviation. It started after I watched Porco Rosso, another Studio Ghibli film with more mature themes. I loved it because, like most of Miyazaki’s films, it didn’t fully make sense the first time — but it stayed with me in a way that made me keep thinking about it. That led me down a rabbit hole into amphibious planes and seaplanes. I find them fascinating because they represent the perfect middle ground between land and water, capable of touching down on a remote lake or lifting off from the sea itself — not to mention you can also fly regular planes on land. There’s something so freeing about the idea — no airport required, just sky above and water below. Some of the smaller models only carry a few passengers, almost like a flying boat for explorers, and I can’t help but imagine them being part of someone’s Odyssey, hopping from coastline to coastline, discovering hidden corners of the world that regular planes could never reach. I can’t help but imagine how incredible it would be if such planes were part of the journey. Being able to land on a remote island or take off from a quiet river somewhere in the world feels like the perfect metaphor for what I want this adventure to be: unbound, adaptable, and a little bit magical.\n\nThose photos you sent honestly made my day — and when you said I might one day stand in the same spot as part of my Odyssey, it filled me with a huge sense of joy. It felt like catching a brief glimpse of the road ahead, and that’s priceless to me. The way you captured Hong Kong really brought the city to life — it feels like a place that’s constantly in motion, restless yet layered with history. I could almost see myself weaving through those neon-lit streets, getting lost in the chaos but also finding quiet moments tucked between it all. Maybe when I finally get there, I’ll seek out the very same spot you stood, take a photo, and send it back to you — a small full-circle moment across time and distance.\n\nUntil then, I’ll keep adding places like Hong Kong to my list. Thanks for giving me a little preview through your eyes.\n\nUntil next time, friend,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n别担心回复晚了——香港听起来就是个完美的借口 😅。我只能想象那里的霓虹灯、拥挤的街道和突如其来的能量。那一定是一场最美好的混乱。不过我很好奇——你有没有抽空尝尝街头小吃，还是全都忙于工作和奔波？\n\n你提到的给自己买电脑配件的故事让我感同身受。我想每个人都有自己的“放纵漏洞”。你过去是工作需要的科技产品，现在则是外出就餐，而我的则是新小玩意、健身服装和自我护理产品——虽然我知道这也会随着时间改变。当别人问起时，我通常会说这是自我提升的一种方式——至少我是这么看待的。从某种意义上说，我们并没有什么不同：你当时是在投资电脑配件以继续创作，而我是在投资自己以不断进步。\n\n至于《星际穿越》……那其实是我的第一次观看——而且是在大银幕上看的，这使得它更加难忘。诺兰有一种将时间和情感扭曲的能力，让你感觉自己既渺小又无限。我理解你为什么会多次重看这部电影——它确实是一部每次观看都能发现新东西的电影。如果非要选的话，你第二喜欢的诺兰电影是哪一部？\n\n最近，我又重新燃起了对航空的兴趣。这始于我看了宫崎骏的另一部成熟主题电影《红猪》。我喜欢这部电影，因为它像宫崎骏的大多数作品一样，第一次看时并不完全理解，但会一直留在心中，让人不断思考。这引导我深入了解了两栖飞机和水上飞机。我觉得它们非常迷人，因为它们代表了陆地和水域之间的完美中间地带，可以在偏远的湖泊降落，也可以从海面上起飞——更不用说你还可以在陆地上驾驶普通飞机。这种想法让人感到无比自由——不需要机场，只有天空和水面。一些较小的型号只能搭载几名乘客，几乎像是一艘探险者的飞艇，我无法不想象它们成为某人奥德赛的一部分，从一个海岸线跳到另一个海岸线，发现那些普通飞机永远无法到达的隐秘角落。如果这样的飞机成为旅程的一部分，该是多么美妙——能够在偏远的岛屿上降落，或者从世界某个安静的河流起飞，这对我来说就像是我想要的冒险的完美隐喻：不受束缚、适应性强，还带有一点点魔幻色彩。\n\n你发来的那些照片真的让我一整天都心情愉快——当你说到我有一天可能会站在同样的地方，作为我的奥德赛的一部分，这让我感到非常高兴。这就像瞥见了前方的道路，对我来说，这是无价的。你拍摄的香港真的让这座城市活了起来——它感觉像是一个不断运动的地方，不安分但又充满历史。我几乎可以想象自己穿梭在那些霓虹灯下的街道，迷失在混乱中，但也能在其中找到安静的时刻。也许当我最终到达那里时，我会找到你站过的那个地方，拍张照片，再发给你——这将是一个跨越时间和距离的小循环时刻。\n\n在此之前，我会继续把像香港这样的地方加入我的清单。感谢你通过你的眼睛给了我一点预览。\n\n下次见，朋友，\nMoni",

    "content": "Hi Kel,\n\nJust to clear up something from my last letter — when I said things were “chaotic” in Hong Kong, I didn’t mean the city itself was intense, haha. I was talking about my own workload. The jewelry exhibition I came for is quite important for me and my partner’s project, so the days have been packed. Honestly I haven’t been sleeping much at night, 我每天都很累 (I feel tired every day), but still pushing through.\n\nThis is actually my first time working in the jewelry industry. 说实话 (to be honest), it isn’t exactly a passion of mine. The price tags are so high that I sometimes feel out of my depth. So for now, 我走一步看一步吧 (Literally, it means \"take one step at a time and see what comes next,\" which can be interpreted as \"improvisation.\"), and see where it leads.\n\nYou mentioned being curious about my lifestyle — I’d say it has two sides. On one hand, yes, it’s very free; I can shape my own projects. On the other hand, 没有坐班的工作 (not having an office job) can weigh on me sometimes. Freedom and pressure, constantly overlapping.\n\nAs for Hong Kong itself, at first I was impressed by the cultural shock of it all — like you said, it really does feel like an international hub, full of people from everywhere. But after a few visits, I started noticing the less glamorous side: the infrastructure isn’t always great, a lot of things feel old, and the general vibe carries this constant pressure.\n\nYour major in electrical engineering sounds solid! I don’t fully grasp the details, but I imagine it overlaps with programming more than you think. If you’re serious about becoming a programmer, maybe try building small open-source projects, or joining developer communities. It could also help to explore AI tools early on — these days, with GPT, Copilot, Gemini and so on, even a 文科生 like me (a humanities graduate like me) can put together small programs.\n\nBy the way, the Chinese you wrote was perfect! 我很惊讶 (I was impressed). I think the hardest part for foreign learners is vocabulary — memorizing words takes extra effort. 加油 (keep it up), and I hope my letters give you a bit of practice.\n\nMy Hong Kong trip is wrapping up now; I’m supposed to fly back to the mainland tomorrow.

    "translatedContent": "嗨，Kel，\n\n澄清一下我上一封信里提到的一点——当我说香港“混乱”时，并不是指这座城市本身很紧张，哈哈。我是指自己的工作量很大。这次来参加的珠宝展览对我和我的合作伙伴的项目非常重要，所以每天的日程都排得满满的。老实说，我晚上几乎没怎么睡好，每天都很累，但还是在坚持。\n\n这其实是我第一次涉足珠宝行业。说实话，这并不是我的热情所在。那些价格标签高得让我有时感到力不从心。所以现在，我只能走一步看一步，看看会走向何方。\n\n你提到对我的生活方式感到好奇——我想说它有两面性。一方面，确实很自由；我可以自己塑造项目。另一方面，没有固定办公室的工作有时也会让我感到压力。自由与压力，总是交织在一起。\n\n至于香港本身，一开始我被这里的文化冲击所震撼——正如你所说，这里确实像一个国际大都市，充满了来自世界各地的人。但几次访问之后，我开始注意到不那么光鲜的一面：基础设施并不总是很好，很多东西显得老旧，整体氛围中总有一种持续的压力。\n\n你选择的电气工程专业听起来很靠谱！虽然我不完全理解其中的细节，但我想象它与编程的交集可能比你想象的要多。如果你认真考虑成为一名程序员，可以尝试构建一些小型的开源项目，或者加入开发者社区。提前探索AI工具也会有帮助——如今，有了GPT、Copilot、Gemini等工具，像我这样的文科生也能编写一些小程序。\n\n顺便说一下，你写的中文非常完美！我很惊讶。我觉得对外国学习者来说，最难的部分是词汇——记忆单词需要额外的努力。加油，希望我的信能给你一些练习的机会。\n\n我的香港之行即将结束，明天应该要飞回大陆了。唯一的变数是台风正在经过，希望它不会影响我的航班。\n\n你那边怎么样？那些交织的故事线开始理顺了吗，还是依然陷在那个视频游戏的混乱中？\n\n最好的祝福，\nDomino",

Hope the chaos settles down soon.\n\nThe reality vs expectation thing with Hong Kong is so relatable! I think I imagined it as exciting because of all the movies and stories about this bustling international hub with amazing food and culture. But you're right - when you actually experience that super fast pace where people automatically speed up just walking, it probably gets overwhelming pretty quickly. What were some of the biggest differences between what you expected and what you actually experienced there?\n\nHalf-freelancer in marketing and media sounds incredible! I'm honestly a bit jealous - the flexibility and variety of working with different clients must be so refreshing compared to a fixed office job. That's actually something I think about sometimes too.\n\nThe jewelry exhibition project sounds fascinating! I bet the pieces you're working with are absolutely beautiful. Is this your first time working in the jewelry industry, or have you done similar projects before?\n\nAbout my China dreams - 我从小就有这个梦想 (I've had this dream since I was little). I can't really explain why, but something about the culture, the language, the opportunities there just calls to me. It's been this persistent dream that I keep chasing.\n\nMy major is actually electrical engineering with a focus on robotics - quite different from what you might have guessed! And honestly, I'm not sure if it will directly help with my future work since 我想成为程序员 (I want to become a programmer). There's some overlap with the technical skills, but it's not exactly the path I originally envisioned.\n\nPlease do mix in Chinese! 如果你不介意的话，我很感激 (If you don't mind, I'd really appreciate it). It would be such great practice for me.\n\nAs for overlapping storylines right now... honestly I'm a bit confused about them myself hahaha. Between studying robotics while dreaming of programming, learning Chinese while being in Indonesia, and trying to figure out my future - it's all a bit tangled up right now.\n\nWhat about you - how are your Hong Kong storylines overlapping with your regular work life?\n\nBest,\nKel",

This week my replies might be slower than usual.\n\nReading about your “indulgence purchases” reminded me of my own university years. Back then, I was also juggling small freelance gigs — not marketing like now, but video editing. I’d earn a little extra each month, and yet somehow, none of it ever stayed in my pocket. Looking back, I realize most of it was swallowed by new computer parts or phone upgrades 🤣. At the time I convinced myself it was “necessary for work,” but honestly, it was just me spoiling myself in the only way I knew.\n\nAnd Interstellar — what a masterpiece. I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it before, but I’ve watched that film at least ten times. Nolan’s way of weaving story and image together feels almost unfairly brilliant. Every time I revisit it, I notice something new, something that makes me rethink the whole film again.\n\nI’ve attached a few photos from Hong Kong. Maybe one day you’ll step onto these same streets as part of your Odyssey.

    "content": "Dear Dominoh,\n\nI think your perspective on Web3 makes a lot of sense. The way you describe it — chaotic, unbalanced, and full of speculation — really captures why it feels unstable for most people. I agree that it’s better to treat it as curiosity for now, at least until it matures into something more practical. I like the way you put it: “you can’t earn money beyond the limits of your own understanding.” There’s something very grounding about that. Like you, I’d rather build something sustainable and tangible than gamble on something I don’t fully grasp. Still, the technical side is fascinating — decentralized systems, devices acting together, new ways to store and share information — those ideas feel like seeds of something meaningful in the long run.\n\nYour dinner story made me smile. I haven’t heard of Hamazushi, but the idea of a conveyor-belt sushi place sounds fun. I can definitely understand why food is your indulgence; there’s something honest about spending on meals that bring joy, whether it’s with people you care about or just treating yourself. For me, my “ruin the budget but worth it” indulgences are usually gadgets — a new smartwatch, headphones, laptop accessories — and from time to time self-care products or gym clothes. Those little purchases always feel rewarding, even if they weren’t strictly necessary.\n\nMoments like the one you described — enjoying good food, laughing with loved ones — feel like investments in memory, not money. In the end, I think those are the things that stay with us longer than anything stored away in numbers.\n\nLately I’ve been keeping my shopping habits more balanced. I mostly spend on gadgets like a new smartwatch, headphones, or laptop accessories, and from time to time I treat myself with some self-care products or gym clothes.\n\nYesterday was quite special. I went to the cinema with my cousins and my two siblings to watch Interstellar. It was my first time seeing it on the big screen, and the experience felt almost otherworldly. The music, the visuals, and the silence of space all struck me in a way that watching at home never could. But more than that, sharing it with my family made the night unforgettable—we walked out of the theater quietly at first, each of us still lost in thought, and then slowly the conversation grew, everyone reflecting in their own way. It’s one of those memories that I think will stay with me for a long time.\n\nWarm regards,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Dominoh，\n\n我觉得你对Web3的看法很有道理。你描述的那样——混乱、不平衡、充满投机——确实抓住了为什么大多数人觉得它不稳定的原因。我同意，目前最好把它当作一种好奇心，至少等到它成熟到更实用的时候。我喜欢你所说的：“你不能赚到超出你理解范围的钱。”这句话非常接地气。和你一样，我更愿意建立一些可持续和具体的东西，而不是在我不完全理解的事情上赌博。不过，技术方面确实很吸引人——去中心化系统、设备协同工作、新的存储和分享信息的方式——这些想法感觉像是长远来看有意义的种子。\n\n你提到的晚餐故事让我笑了。我还没听说过Hamazushi，但传送带寿司店的想法听起来很有趣。我完全能理解为什么食物是你的享受；花钱在能带来快乐的餐点上，无论是和你关心的人一起，还是自己犒劳自己，都有一种真诚的感觉。对我来说，那些“虽然超出预算但值得”的享受通常是小玩意儿——比如新的智能手表、耳机、笔记本配件——偶尔还会买一些自我护理产品或健身服。这些小购买总是让人感到满足，即使它们并不是严格意义上的必需品。\n\n像你描述的那样——享受美食、与亲人欢笑——这些时刻感觉像是对记忆的投资，而不是金钱。最终，我认为这些才是比任何数字存储的东西更长久地留在我们心中的东西。\n\n最近，我尽量让我的购物习惯更加平衡。我主要花在小玩意儿上，比如新的智能手表、耳机或笔记本配件，偶尔会买一些自我护理产品或健身服。\n\n昨天非常特别。我和堂兄弟姐妹以及两个兄弟姐妹一起去电影院看了《星际穿越》。这是我第一次在大银幕上看这部电影，体验几乎超凡脱俗。音乐、视觉效果和太空的寂静都以一种在家观看所无法比拟的方式打动了我。但更重要的是，与家人一起分享这一时刻让这个夜晚变得难忘——我们走出电影院时先是静静地，每个人都在沉思，然后慢慢地，谈话逐渐增多，每个人都在以自己的方式反思。这是一段我想会长久留在记忆中的回忆。\n\n温暖的问候，\nMoni",

    "content": "Hi Lamine 😟\n\nAbout freelancing — my answer is: yes, it’s hard. I often feel anxious, sometimes even short-tempered. I know my state of mind isn’t always right, but for now I don’t have a real solution. I’m simply not the kind of person who can accept “stability.” In China, many people dream of civil service jobs, but I never consider that path. The idea of working in the same position for decades until retirement feels like a personal disaster. Even if it means stress and uncertainty, I’d rather live a short life that touches as many new things as possible.\n\nYou mentioned not wanting to visit Arab countries — honestly, I partly agree. For me, what influences me more is the attitude toward Muslims. I feel that some parts of Islamic doctrine are strange and outdated. I don’t think it’s a great religion (but then again, is there any “perfect” religion in this world? Except maybe the Flying Spaghetti Monster 😅).\n\nAbout racism — I think your point about “ignorance” is probably right. Especially with discrimination against Asians, a lot of it comes from old stereotypes and, as you said, lack of understanding. To me, what really divides people is education and environment (both geographic and social). Green Book is my favorite road movie, without question. It dives deep into the issue of racism while also telling a powerful human story. I loved it.\n\nRegarding the rise of extreme voices online — I have a theory. In the past, the internet had higher entry barriers. Owning a PC and being able to access information communities required a certain level of education and resources, which shaped a healthier online environment. Later, with Web 2.0, the internet expanded to almost everyone. There’s a Chinese saying: “When the forest grows, all kinds of birds appear.” That’s exactly how I see today’s internet. Many people with limited perspectives or difficult lives use the internet to vent their frustrations. Maybe in real life they receive no respect, so the only way they can assert themselves is by attacking strangers online.\n\nTomorrow I’ll fly to Hong Kong for a work trip that lasts about a week. My motorcycle exam will have to wait until I get back. I do enjoy driving, though. Still, I think most people I know in China see driving as just a necessary skill, not something to enjoy. My boyfriend, for example, has a license but rarely drives our car — he prefers just calling a taxi.\n\nBut Yoshi… oh my god. I was shocked and furious to read what happened. How could someone hurt an innocent cat like that? It makes me both angry and deeply sad. When I saw the photo, my chest tightened — poor Yoshi, I can only imagine how scared and hurt he must have been. If I were there, I literally would have cried and wanted to punch someone. I truly hope he recovers well, and that you too can find a little peace. I know how exhausting anxiety and insomnia can be, and this kind of event makes it so much worse. As for your brother and sister-in-law, I believe there must be reasons behind such a painful choice. Adults sometimes have to make hard decisions… but I still hope things will settle in the best possible way for them, and for you.\n\nPlease give Yoshi a gentle pat from me.\n\nTake care,\nDomino 🌿",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine 😟\n\n关于自由职业——我的回答是：是的，这很难。我经常感到焦虑，有时甚至脾气暴躁。我知道我的心态并不总是正确的，但目前我还没有找到真正的解决办法。我并不是那种能接受“稳定”的人。在中国，很多人都梦想着公务员的工作，但我从未考虑过这条路。在同一个职位上工作几十年直到退休，对我来说就像是一场个人灾难。即使这意味着压力和不确定性，我也宁愿过一种尽可能多接触新事物的短暂生活。\n\n你提到不想去阿拉伯国家——老实说，我部分同意。对我来说，影响我更多的是对穆斯林的态度。我觉得伊斯兰教的一些教义很奇怪，甚至过时。我不认为它是一个伟大的宗教（但话说回来，世界上有“完美”的宗教吗？除了可能的飞天面条神 😅）。\n\n关于种族主义——我认为你关于“无知”的观点可能是对的。尤其是对亚洲人的歧视，很多都来自旧的刻板印象，正如你所说，缺乏理解。对我来说，真正将人们分开的是教育和环境（地理和社会环境）。《绿皮书》是我最喜欢的公路电影，毫无疑问。它深入探讨了种族主义问题，同时也讲述了一个强有力的人性故事。我非常喜欢它。\n\n关于网上极端声音的兴起——我有一个理论。过去，互联网的进入门槛较高。拥有个人电脑并能够访问信息社区需要一定的教育和资源，这塑造了一个更健康的网络环境。后来，随着Web 2.0的发展，互联网扩展到了几乎每个人。有句中国话说：“林子大了，什么鸟都有。”这正是我如何看待今天的互联网。许多视野有限或生活艰难的人利用互联网发泄他们的不满。也许在现实生活中他们得不到尊重，所以他们只能通过在网上攻击陌生人来证明自己。\n\n明天我将飞往香港，进行为期大约一周的商务旅行。我的摩托车考试只能等我回来后再进行。不过，我还是很喜欢开车。尽管如此，我认为我在中国认识的大多数人把开车看作是一项必要的技能，而不是享受。比如我男朋友，他有驾照，但很少开我们的车——他更喜欢叫出租车。\n\n但说到Yoshi……天哪，我读到发生的事情时既震惊又愤怒。怎么能有人伤害一只无辜的猫呢？这让我既生气又深感悲伤。当我看到照片时，我的心紧缩——可怜的Yoshi，我只能想象他当时有多害怕和受伤。如果我在那里，我简直会哭出来，甚至想揍人。我真心希望他能恢复得很好，也希望你能找到一些平静。我知道焦虑和失眠有多么令人疲惫，这种事件只会让情况更糟。至于你的哥哥和嫂子，我相信他们做出这样痛苦的决定一定有原因。成年人有时不得不做出艰难的决定……但我仍然希望事情能以最好的方式解决，对他们，对你也是如此。\n\n请替我轻轻抚摸Yoshi。\n\n保重，\nDomino 🌿",

I mean, aren't you sometimes afraid you'll run out of projects?\n\nIndia is on my list of countries not to visit too haha, there are things happening in India that I don't agree with at all. Other countries I don't want to visit are Arab countries haha.\n\nI think colonization has defined the way Westerners see black people. Speaking of \"slant eyes\", I think that here in Africa we also have prejudices about other peoples, even if it's not hatred but rather ignorance, so I wonder how to tell the difference between some ignorance about a people and racism?\n\nYes, it's very scandalous, sometimes there are even murders, recently in France a young Malian was stabbed in a mosque by a white man, now in Western countries, especially in the United States, there's a wave of extremists on the rise. On twitter ( x) when I read some of their comments it makes me want to vomit, I don't understand why a human would hate another person so much and you know most of these extremists claim to be Christian ( I don't think Jesus approves of their behavior).\n\nYou're right, when the time comes, I'll see which studies really appeal to me.\n\nOh sorry, I hope that next time you'll manage to get your motorcycle license...!\nIt's true, even if you're not going to buy a motorcycle it's better to have your license. At my age, not knowing how to drive a car makes me feel ashamed haha...\n\nOtherwise Domino, something horrible happened on Tuesday, my cat Yoshi was seriously attacked by some guys outside, we thought he was going to die but well we went to the vet, he was treated and now he's much better. Now my anxiety and insomnia are back since Yoshi's attack, I feel very bad mentally and my big brother and his wife are talking about divorce even though they've just had a child. I'm trying to get better mentally but something always has to happen to ruin everything \nHere's a photo I took of Yoshi today, you can see his eye.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nLamine 🥀",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nAbout Web3 — if I’m being honest, my advice to most people is to just keep it at the “curiosity” level. The current environment is still far from healthy. It’s mostly a mix of chaos, whales squeezing smaller players, and gamblers chasing the next big hit. Maybe this is what a completely free version of the stock market would look like. Personally, I’ve always felt finance isn’t the kind of field I want to stake my future on. I’m not good at speculation, and I hold onto the belief that “you can’t earn money beyond the limits of your own understanding.” So instead of trying to outsmart the markets, I’d rather stick to the “dumb way” — selling my time and labor, bit by bit, to build something sustainable. It may not be glamorous, but at least it feels like a path I can control.\n\nThat being said, I still find Web3 interesting in a more technical sense. The idea of decentralized systems, people’s devices working together as a “server,” and new ways of publishing or storing content — that’s something worth paying attention to. Even if it’s messy now, the principles might spark better use cases in the future. For me, playing with it is less about chasing money and more about trying to understand where things might be headed.\n\nOn a lighter note — I went out last night with my boyfriend and my roommate to Hamazushi. I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, but it’s a conveyor-belt sushi chain here. I’m obsessed with their foie gras sushi; every time I go, it’s the highlight of the meal. The only downside is that I always spend more than I planned. I wouldn’t say I’m poor, but let’s just say my Engel coefficient (the share of income spent on food) stays embarrassingly high. Food is one of those things I can’t seem to compromise on. Some people save for fashion or gadgets; I end up saving for dinner.\n\nMoments like that remind me of how I live — not chasing speculation, not hoarding wealth, but spending where it actually brings joy. Maybe that’s its own kind of investment, even if it doesn’t grow in numbers. What about you? Do you have that one food or indulgence that always ruins your budget but still feels worth it every single time?\n\nTake care,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n关于Web3——说实话，我给大多数人的建议是保持在“好奇心”水平。目前的环境还远未健康。它主要是一片混乱，大玩家挤压小玩家，赌徒追逐下一个大热门。这可能就是完全自由的股票市场会有的样子。我个人一直觉得金融不是我愿意押注未来的地方。我不擅长投机，而且我一直坚持“赚不到超出自己理解范围的钱”这个信念。所以，与其试图战胜市场，我更愿意选择“笨方法”——一点一滴地出卖时间和劳动，建立一些可持续的东西。这可能不够风光，但至少感觉是一条我可以掌控的道路。\n\n话说回来，我仍然对Web3在技术层面上感到兴趣。去中心化系统的概念，人们的设备协同工作作为“服务器”，以及新的发布或存储内容的方式——这些都是值得关注的。即使现在很混乱，这些原则可能会在未来激发更好的应用场景。对我来说，玩转这些技术更多的是为了理解未来可能的方向，而不是追逐金钱。\n\n轻松一点的话题——昨晚我和男朋友以及室友去了Hamazushi。不知道你听说过没有，这里有一家回转寿司连锁店。我特别喜欢他们的鹅肝寿司，每次去都是餐桌上最亮点。唯一的缺点是我总是花得比计划的多。我不会说自己穷，但我的恩格尔系数（收入中用于食物的比例）总是高得令人尴尬。食物是我无法妥协的一件事。有些人为了时尚或电子产品存钱，而我则为了晚餐存钱。\n\n这样的时刻让我想起我是如何生活的——不追逐投机，不囤积财富，而是把钱花在真正带来快乐的地方。也许这本身就是一种投资，即使它不会在数字上增长。你呢？有没有那样一种食物或享受，总是超出预算，但每次都觉得值得？\n\n保重，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nThanks for your letter — I’m sure you’ll nail the motorcycle test next time, and it’s exciting that you’ll be traveling to Hong Kong. Picking up your new phone there sounds like quite the adventure in itself. I hope the trip goes smoothly.\n\nI understand what you mean about the gym. That cycle between weight and motivation is a tough one. For me, starting small and slowly building momentum helped. Even light movement can make a difference once it becomes consistent. I believe you’ll find the right chance when the timing feels right — sometimes it’s just about taking that very first step.\n\nI appreciate the encouragement for French. You’re right, vocabulary feels like the biggest wall. I’m setting myself to start learning seriously soon, and I’ll try to stay disciplined with it. Hearing how you managed English gives me motivation that it’s possible.\n\nGlad to hear the weather in Nanjing is cooling down — 27°C sounds much more comfortable compared to running the AC nonstop. Here in Egypt, it’s been 35°C to 37°C and cools down to 27°C to 25°C at night, which is the time I go to do my gym session.\n\nThat’s fascinating about Web3. Ordering a phone with a built-in crypto wallet just to pick it up in Hong Kong shows real commitment. I admire your persistence in learning despite the hurdles. Personally, I’m more of a curious observer for now. I like reading and learning about crypto, but I haven’t bought any myself yet. Maybe one day, once I feel more prepared and informed, I’ll give it a try.\n\nLooking forward to hearing about your Hong Kong trip and how the new phone works out.\n\nTake care,\nMoni",

    "content": "Hi Lamine, \n\nI think I mentioned it before…? My memory isn’t the best, so maybe I’m repeating myself. Anyway, right now I’m sort of half a freelancer. I don’t have an office job, but I do have a few steady clients and projects that keep me going.\n\nI can understand what you said about always wanting to have a home to return to. For many people that’s very important. As for countries I really don’t want to visit… maybe India would be on that list. From my (admittedly limited) impression, the hygiene there seems questionable, and I’m afraid I’d end up dying from the food by the Ganges River (…dark joke, I know).\n\nI also agree with you that most Asians are relatively okay with Africans — often more curious about “foreigners” than hateful. The internet tends to magnify extreme voices. For example, when the streamer Speed came to China, most fans welcomed him warmly, but he did run into a few people who rudely threw the N-word at him (probably thinking it was a “joke” to see his reaction). But just like when Chinese abroad encounter people doing the “slant-eye” gesture — even if someone thinks it’s a joke, it’s still offensive.\n\nOn politeness: I think you’re right. At least in my experience, most Chinese people are genuinely polite. It’s not really “forced,” but rather something encouraged by the social environment. I honestly didn’t know that in some Western countries, extremists could go as far as beating or insulting non-white people. That’s… outrageous.\n\nAbout your master’s studies — if it were me, I’d choose based on two things: passion and strength. If a subject meets both, that’s ideal. I’ve never liked the idea of picking a major just because it’s “good for jobs.” If you end up spending your life working in something you don’t enjoy, that feels pretty empty to me.\n\nNow, the bad news… I didn’t pass my motorcycle license exam 😞. One of the tests was a slalom, and the technique my school taught me didn’t match the real setup at the test site. As a result, I kept failing at the same point. I’ll have to rebook the exam in a few days. This time I plan to go straight to the test center and ask their staff about the exact setup. But before that, I have a work trip to Hong Kong.\n\nBy the way, I’m not actually planning to buy a motorcycle to ride every day. On one hand, I already have a car, which is more than enough for daily use. On the other hand, I just feel it’s necessary to get the license anyway — a bit like how I only drive automatic cars but still took the manual transmission test when I got my license. It’s a kind of “just in case” mindset. You never know when it might come in handy.\n\nThat’s all for now. And congratulations again on becoming an uncle for the second time — that’s wonderful news! 🎉\n\nÀ bientôt,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine，\n\n我想我之前提到过……？我的记性不太好，所以可能是我在重复自己。不管怎样，我现在算是半个自由职业者。我没有办公室工作，但有几个稳定的客户和项目让我能维持下去。\n\n我能理解你说的总是想要有个家可以回去的感觉。对很多人来说，这非常重要。至于我实在不想去的国家……印度可能会上榜。从我（坦白说，有限的）印象来看，那里的卫生状况似乎不太理想，我担心自己会因为恒河畔的食物而丧命（……我知道这是个黑色笑话）。\n\n我也同意你的看法，大多数亚洲人对非洲人相对友好——更多的是对“外国人”的好奇，而不是仇恨。互联网往往会放大极端的声音。比如，当主播Speed来中国时，大多数粉丝都热情地欢迎他，但他确实遇到了几个粗鲁地对他使用N字的人（可能认为这是个“玩笑”，想看看他的反应）。就像中国人在国外遇到有人做“眯眯眼”手势一样——即使有人认为这是个玩笑，但仍然是冒犯的。\n\n关于礼貌：我觉得你是对的。至少以我的经验来看，大多数中国人确实很真诚地礼貌。这并不是“被迫的”，而是社会环境所鼓励的。我真不知道在一些西方国家，极端分子竟然会去殴打或侮辱非白人。这……太离谱了。\n\n关于你的硕士学习——如果是我，我会根据两方面来选择：热情和优势。如果一个专业两者都符合，那自然是最好的。我从来不喜欢因为某个专业“就业前景好”就去选择它。如果最终你要在自己不喜欢的领域工作一辈子，那感觉太空虚了。\n\n现在，坏消息……我的摩托车驾照考试没通过 😞。其中一项测试是绕桩，学校教我的技巧与实际考试场地的设置不符。结果我在同一个地方总是失败。我得过几天重新预约考试。这次我打算直接去考试中心，向工作人员询问具体的设置。但在这之前，我有一个去香港的工作行程。\n\n顺便说一句，我其实并不打算每天骑摩托车。一方面，我已经有车了，日常使用已经足够。另一方面，我觉得拿到驾照还是有必要的——有点像我虽然只开自动挡的车，但拿驾照时还是考了手动挡。这是一种“以防万一”的心态。你永远不知道什么时候它会派上用场。\n\n就这些了。再次恭喜你第二次成为叔叔——这是个好消息！🎉\n\nÀ bientôt，\nDomino",

I’ve never been good at exercising… laziness and my weight have formed a vicious cycle. The heavier I get, the less I want to move; the less I move, the heavier I become. I don’t know when I’ll find the right chance to finally break that loop.\n\nStill, I think with your discipline and initiative, learning French won’t be too difficult. Vocabulary is always the biggest wall in language learning. Once you know enough words, the rest starts falling into place.

The average temperature today was around 27°C. Standing under the sun is still hot, but at least I don’t need to run the AC anymore.\n\nAs for Web3 — the learning curve is steep. That’s probably why it took me years of stopping and restarting to finally get a clearer picture of how it works. (I have to admit, GPT helped a lot — learning in a Q&A format makes things so much easier.) I haven’t gone super deep into it, but just today I ordered a new phone with a built-in crypto hardware wallet. It can’t even be shipped to mainland China, so I had to send it to my hotel in Hong Kong and will pick it up when I get there. Kind of a hassle, but hopefully it’s worth it. At the very least, I think it’ll give me another angle to understand Web3 in practice.\n\nWould you ever actually buy crypto yourself, or are you more of a curious observer?\n\nTalk soon,\nDomino",

We all get them from time to time.\n\nAh, I’m sorry to hear about the motorcycle test! 😅 But I think your approach to contacting the exam site directly next time is really smart. It’s frustrating to deal with unreliable schools, but at least you’re treating this more as a learning experience than just a means to get a bike. Even failing once is still progress, and I’m sure you’ll nail it next time. Plus, it’s kind of inspiring to see you picking up new skills like that!\n\nFrench definitely sounds like a mixed bag. Pronunciation being “read as written” is a blessing, but all the genders and verb tenses… ugh, I feel for you. I’m gearing up for that part myself, and your encouragement helps — I’ll take your “good luck” very seriously. \n\nAbout my night shift — thanks for noticing! It’s not easy, but thankfully, my gym is open 24/7, so I can get my workouts in whenever I have free time. Mostly, I stick to late-night sessions, doing a PPL routine (Push Pull Legs).

Hopefully, the cooler days come soon so you can enjoy a break from the sticky air.\n\nAnd yes, I was a little worried about my laptop, but it’s back and working perfectly now — huge relief. I’m glad to finally have it back in my hands, haha.\n\nI get what you mean about motorcycles. Sportbikes are flashy, but not the most practical for daily use. I kind of like the idea of small, efficient scooters to but I will always choose the sport bike over a practical one. That Honda Super Cub sounds adorable — I’d probably smile every time I saw one on the street. \n\nOh, and by the way, I’ve been looking into Web3 recently — it’s fascinating! I’ve started exploring how blockchain and decentralized tech are being used in creative and financial spaces. Honestly, it feels a bit overwhelming at first, but the potential is really exciting.

Next time, I’m planning to contact the exam site directly beforehand and ask one of their coaches to show me some tricks — maybe that’ll make things smoother. I’m not too upset though. Honestly, getting the license was more about picking up another skill than about actually buying a bike. In any case, I have to wait a week before I can book the exam again, so for now I’ll just stay calm and go with the flow.\n\nWhen I first started learning French, I also thought it was surprisingly approachable. The pronunciation is convenient — most words can be read as they’re written, which is easier than the endless “exceptions” in English. But what drove me crazy were the genders and the one million verb tenses. Well… good luck to you with that part. ;)\n\nYour night shift sounds painful. Saving your free time for the late hours makes a lot of things harder to do. Still, I think your plan is solid — but I do wonder, are gyms even open at 3 a.m.? Or do you have some other way to work out? Either way, it shows a lot of self-discipline, which is definitely a good thing. (I wish I could say the same — I’m more on the procrastination side, honestly…)\n\nHere in Nanjing, the weather has turned hot again — and worse, it’s the humid kind of heat. According to the lunar calendar it’s already autumn, but… well, China has a saying, 秋老虎 (“autumn tiger”), meaning autumn can still burn you with summer heat. It’s exhausting. I really hope the temperature drops soon, because I can’t stand sticky air.\n\nAnd haha — so you were actually worried about not getting your laptop back at all? I thought in your last letter you were just anxious the repair guy might not fix it properly. Either way, at least now it’s back in your hands and working.\n\nAs for motorcycles… honestly I’m not a fan of the sportbike style. They look cool, but they feel more like oversized toys: not exactly comfortable, picky about road conditions, more for show than for daily use. For me, motorcycles are mostly about short-distance commuting, so I think I’d be more into small-displacement scooters. Actually, there’s one model I really like — the Honda Super Cub. It’s adorable. 🤣\n\nTalk soon,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n抱歉回复晚了一些——我最近心情不太好，做什么都提不起劲。\n\n……先说坏消息吧：我的摩托车考试没过。😱 我开始怀疑我选的驾校不太靠谱。下次我打算直接联系考场，找他们的教练给我指点一些技巧——也许这样会顺利些。不过我也不太沮丧。老实说，考驾照更多是为了学一项新技能，而不是真的打算买摩托车。无论如何，我得等一个星期才能重新预约考试，所以现在我只能保持平静，顺其自然。\n\n刚开始学法语时，我也觉得它意外地容易上手。发音很方便——大多数单词都能按字面读出来，这比英语中无尽的“例外”要简单得多。但让我抓狂的是性别和数不清的动词时态。好吧……这部分你可得加油了。😉\n\n你上夜班听起来真辛苦。把空闲时间留到深夜，很多事情都变得难以处理。不过我觉得你的计划很扎实——只是我在想，健身房会在凌晨3点开门吗？或者你有其他锻炼的方式？无论如何，这都显示了你很强的自律性，这绝对是个好品质。（我可做不到——说实话，我更倾向于拖延……）\n\n南京的天气又变热了——而且是那种潮湿的热。按照农历，现在已经入秋了，但……中国有句话叫 秋老虎（“秋老虎”），意思是秋天还会像夏天一样热。真是让人疲惫。我真希望气温能快点降下来，因为我实在受不了潮湿的空气。\n\n哈哈——原来你担心的是电脑根本拿不回来了？我还以为你上封信里只是担心修理师傅修不好。不管怎样，现在电脑回来了，还能用，真是太好了。\n\n至于摩托车……老实说，我不太喜欢跑车型的。它们看起来很酷，但感觉更像是大型玩具：不怎么舒服，对路况要求高，更多是为了展示而不是日常使用。对我来说，摩托车主要是用于短途通勤，所以我更倾向于小排量的踏板车。其实，有一款我特别喜欢——本田超级幼兽。它太可爱了。🤣\n\n改天聊，\n多米诺",

In other words, I can decide when to rest or take a holiday without asking anyone for permission XD.\n\nIf we’re talking dreams… I don’t think I’d ever really “settle down” in the traditional sense. I don’t feel a strong need for a fixed “home” or “homeland.” My ideal life might be one of constant exploration, moving from place to place, always experiencing something new. Maybe that sounds a bit like an outlaw, or a gypsy spirit, wandering without roots.\n\nYou’re right, racism against Africans is a tough issue. Even in China, where the Black population is very small, you can still see extreme comments on the internet sometimes. Do you think Europe might be better? At least with so-called political correctness, even if some people hold racist views, they wouldn’t dare to show it openly. And from what I know, Europe seems relatively tolerant when it comes to homosexuality.\n\nI’m sorry to hear about the difficulty of the exam :( But since that’s the case, I’d say it makes sense to focus on the Meteorological Agency job. Fingers crossed that you’ll be selected! ✨\n\nAnd yes, pursuing a higher degree sounds like a great idea — especially if you’re considering migration. From what I understand, degrees carry a lot of weight in immigration priority for many countries.\n\nAs for me — these days I’ve been preparing for my motorcycle license test. By the time you read this, I should have finished. Riding a manual bike feels easier than I expected, maybe because I already have 4-wheel driving experience. Altogether I’ve only taken about 2.5 lessons before the exam, so hopefully it won’t be a problem. I really hope I can pass everything in one go tomorrow and finally get that license.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine，\n\n对我来说，“周末”这个概念并不十分明确。如我之前所说，我现在靠几个媒体营销项目生活，所以我的时间安排非常灵活。换句话说，我可以自己决定何时休息或度假，无需征得任何人同意 XD。\n\n如果谈到梦想……我想我可能永远不会以传统意义上的方式“安定下来”。我对固定的“家”或“故乡”没有强烈的渴望。我理想的生活可能是不断探索，从一个地方搬到另一个地方，总是体验新的事物。这听起来可能有点像流浪者，或者吉普赛人的精神，四处漂泊，没有根。\n\n你说得对，针对非洲人的种族主义确实是一个棘手的问题。即使在中国，黑人人口非常少，但有时在互联网上仍能看到极端的言论。你觉得欧洲会更好吗？至少在所谓的政治正确下，即使有些人持有种族主义观点，他们也不敢公开表达。据我所知，欧洲在对待同性恋方面似乎相对宽容。\n\n听到你考试的难度很大，我感到很遗憾 :( 但既然如此，我觉得专注于气象局的工作是个明智的选择。祝你好运，希望你能被选上！✨\n\n是的，追求更高的学位听起来是个好主意——特别是如果你考虑移民的话。据我了解，学位在许多国家的移民优先权中占有很大的分量。\n\n至于我——最近我一直在准备摩托车驾照考试。等你看到这封信时，我应该已经考完了。骑手动挡的摩托车比我预期的要容易，可能是因为我已经有四轮驾驶的经验。总共我只上了大约2.5节课就去考试了，希望不会有太大问题。我真心希望明天能一次性通过所有考试，最终拿到驾照。\n\nÀ bientôt，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nYour explanation of Web3 was honestly the clearest I’ve ever read. The “United States in cyberspace without a federal government” line really clicked for me. I can imagine how that blogging system would work now — it’s fascinating how the whole thing doesn’t rely on just one person’s server, but spreads across everyone involved. The more I hear about it, the more I feel like Web3 might change the way people think about ownership and connection online. I’ll definitely explore it further — it sounds like a really interesting and promising idea.\n\nBy the way, I had my first French lessons just two days ago. They weren’t as bad as I expected! For Arabic speakers, French is actually easier to pronounce than English — crazy, right? Of course, I’m still a beginner, but it gave me some motivation knowing it might not be as difficult as I thought.\n\nI also remembered I told you I’d share my September plans. This month, I want to stay consistent at the gym and keep improving, while also finding time for reading and gradually improving my French. Additionally, I’m working on developing better daily habits and preparing for university. My coworker suggested an interesting idea since I’m a night owl, and my working shifts is from 5 pm to 2 am and i cant sleep directly after i finish my shift Because of insomnia, I often wake up around 3 pm with only a couple of hours before my shift starts, making it hard to stay consistent with the gym over the past few months. The plan is to do my workout at 3 am after my shift, then shower, read a little, do my French lessons, and work on habits before sleeping. I’d then wake up around 3 pm, accomplishing my daily goals. It feels like a transitional month — not too fast, not too slow, but moving forward.\n\nRegarding Egypt’s weather, you’re right — many think it’s all dry heat. But depending on the city, summer can be quite humid, especially in Cairo, where I live. It’s not sticky every day, but when it hits, it’s exactly as you said — stepping outside makes you want to run back in.\n\nAs for the laptop, lesson learned 😅. That game really caused problems for me. The shop where I left it was sketchy, and I spent three anxious nights wondering if I’d get my system back intact. Luckily, it was returned working fine, just reset, so now it feels like a fresh start.\n\nMotorcycle lessons sound exciting! There’s a sense of freedom in riding on open roads compared to being in a car. I imagine it feeling more direct and natural once you get the hang of it. I’m rooting for you on your test — you’ve got this!\n\nP.S. I’ve always wanted a Honda CBR 600 someday when I have enough funds. Do you have a specific bike in mind?\n\nTalk soon,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n你对Web3的解释是我读过的最清晰的。特别是“网络空间中的美国，没有联邦政府”这句话，让我豁然开朗。现在我能够想象那个博客系统是如何运作的了——整个系统不依赖于某一个人的服务器，而是分散在所有参与者之间，这真是太神奇了。我越了解它，就越觉得Web3可能会改变人们对网络上所有权和连接的看法。我一定会进一步探索，这听起来确实是一个非常有趣且有前景的想法。\n\n顺便说一下，我两天前刚刚上了第一堂法语课。其实并没有我想象中那么难！对于阿拉伯语使用者来说，法语的发音甚至比英语更容易——这听起来是不是很疯狂？当然，我还是个初学者，但知道它可能没有那么难，这给了我一些动力。\n\n我还记得我告诉过你，会分享我的九月计划。这个月，我打算保持在健身房的规律训练，继续提高，同时也要留出时间读书和逐步提高法语水平。此外，我正在努力培养更好的日常习惯，并为大学做准备。我的同事给我提了一个有趣的建议，因为我是个夜猫子，而且我的工作时间是从下午5点到凌晨2点，失眠让我在下班后很难直接入睡。通常情况下，我大约在下午3点醒来，距离上班只有几个小时，这几个月来让我很难坚持去健身房。现在的计划是，在下班后凌晨3点去健身，然后洗澡、读一会儿书、上法语课，再培养一些习惯，最后睡觉。这样我可以在下午3点醒来，完成每天的目标。感觉这是一个过渡期——不急不躁，但稳步前进。\n\n关于埃及的天气，你说得对——很多人以为这里全是干燥的热。但其实不同城市的情况不同，尤其是我住的开罗，夏天会相当潮湿。虽然不是每天都黏糊糊的，但一旦湿度上来，你就会像你说的那样，一出门就想跑回来。\n\n说到笔记本电脑，这次真是长了个教训 😅。那款游戏确实给我带来了不少麻烦。我把它放在的那个修理店看起来不太靠谱，我焦虑了三个晚上，担心系统能不能完好无损地回来。幸好，它最终完好无损地回来了，只是重置了，感觉像是重新开始了一样。\n\n摩托车课程听起来很刺激！骑摩托车在开阔的道路上行驶，比开车感觉更自由。我想，一旦你掌握了技巧，那种感觉会更直接、更自然。我为你加油，你一定可以的！\n\n附：我一直梦想有一天能买一辆本田CBR 600。你有没有心仪的车型？\n\n很快再聊，\nMoni",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nYou asked about Web3 — if I had to put it simply, it’s like this: programs or websites running on Web3 don’t rely on a single dedicated server. Instead, lots of devices around the world share the role of being “the server.” Imagine it as a kind of United States in cyberspace — but without a federal government. Each device saves part of the data and contributes to the computations, and together they keep the content available to users. That’s why people call it a “chain.”\n\nI only started digging deeper into it recently. The reason was that a developer on a geeky forum I often visit made a couple of projects that caught my interest. One was a decentralized blogging system where my posts aren’t stored on his server, but on the devices of other users who run the program. My blog stays online as long as this “chain of PCs” is alive, and every time someone visits, it connects through the network. The second project was that the forum owner even launched his own cryptocurrency, named after the forum itself. I bought a little, not as an investment, but just to understand how things actually work in practice.\n\nBy the way, you said you’ve started learning French! I studied it back in university, though I didn’t invest much effort at the time. Honestly, the best I can say now is probably just one sentence: Je ne parle pas beaucoup de français. 🤣 Still, I hope your lessons go much more smoothly than mine did. Bonne chance!\n\nAbout the weather — I’ve never really had a clear concept of what Egypt’s climate feels like. I always imagined it to be hot and dry, so hearing you describe it as “hot and humid” surprised me. I hate humidity too. The moment you step outside and feel sticky all over… it makes me want to run straight back indoors.\n\nAnd your laptop — seriously, don’t download games from sketchy places XDDD! Virus that damages your system is such a pain. Back when I mainly used Windows, my usual fix was just to reinstall the whole OS. It worked, but it also meant reinstalling every app, redoing all my settings… I hated that part.\n\nAs for me, I’ve just started lessons for a motorcycle license. Compared to driving a manual car, I feel like motorcycles are quicker to get the hang of (though maybe that’s just because I’ve already had years of driving experience). I’ve only done 1.5 practice sessions so far, but I’m feeling confident. My test is the day after tomorrow — fingers crossed I can pass it in one go!\n\nTalk soon,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n你问到了Web3——如果我必须简单概括的话，它就像这样：运行在Web3上的程序或网站不依赖于单一的专用服务器。相反，世界各地的许多设备共同承担了“服务器”的角色。你可以想象它就像网络空间中的一个“美国”——但没有联邦政府。每个设备保存部分数据并参与计算，共同确保内容对用户可用。这就是为什么人们称它为“链”。\n\n我最近才开始深入研究它。原因是我在一个经常访问的极客论坛上，一位开发者做了一些引起我兴趣的项目。其中一个是一个去中心化的博客系统，我的帖子不是存储在他的服务器上，而是存储在运行该程序的其他用户的设备上。只要这个“PC链”活着，我的博客就会在线，每次有人访问时，它都会通过网络连接。第二个项目是论坛所有者甚至推出了自己的加密货币，以论坛的名字命名。我买了一些，不是作为投资，而是为了了解实际操作中的情况。\n\n对了，你说你开始学法语了！我大学时学过，但当时并没有投入太多精力。老实说，我现在能说的最好的一句话可能是：Je ne parle pas beaucoup de français. 🤣 无论如何，我希望你的课程比我当年顺利得多。祝你好运！\n\n关于天气——我从未真正了解过埃及的气候是什么感觉。我一直以为那里是炎热干燥的，所以听到你描述为“炎热潮湿”时，我感到很惊讶。我也讨厌潮湿。只要一出门，全身就黏糊糊的……这让我只想立刻跑回室内。\n\n还有你的笔记本电脑——真的，不要从不正规的地方下载游戏XDDD！病毒损坏系统真是太烦人了。我以前主要用Windows时，通常的解决办法就是重装整个操作系统。虽然有效，但也意味着要重新安装每个应用程序，重做所有设置……我最讨厌这部分了。\n\n至于我自己，我刚刚开始摩托车驾照的课程。与手动挡汽车相比，我觉得摩托车更容易上手（可能只是因为我已经有多年的驾驶经验）。我目前只进行了1.5次练习，但感觉很自信。我的考试就在后天——希望我能一次通过！\n\n很快再聊，\n多米诺",

All I really know is it has something to do with crypto and blockchains, but beyond that, I’m lost. How would you explain it to someone totally new, like me?\n\nAlso, just to update you — September is going to be a busy month for me.

I really want to enter this new chapter with a solid mindset and good habits in place.\n\nI like how you tied the weather shift to a turning page.

Here it’s still ___ (the weather here is very brutal its hot like the sun trying to prove a point but also wet its a mix of the 2 in the worst way possiple), but I’m waiting for my own symbolic rain.\n\nBy the way, I should explain why it took me a little longer than usual to respond. My laptop caught a virus while I was installing a game online, and things got so bad that my Windows system was completely corrupted. I had to take it to a repair shop, but the shop owner, Menna, was acting very sketchy, which left me really anxious since I had to leave my laptop overnight. In the end, it took him three days to fix, and thankfully it’s running fine now with a fresh system — but the whole experience was stressful, to say the least.

If money weren’t an issue, I would absolutely encourage you to follow the path of exploring the world. That’s also something I want to do myself once I’ve saved enough. There’s so much to see, and I think travel has a way of reshaping how we understand life.\n\nAs for the animated film I mentioned — it’s a story about fairies and humans. But the fairies in this film are quite different from the traditional idea; they’re more like beings formed out of the natural spirit of forests, rivers, and mountains. The character designs are really charming too — not the usual fantasy tropes, but something more interesting and unique. I liked it a lot.\n\nI haven’t seen F1 or Superman yet, though!

But the important thing is that it's fixed and you can do your job.\nOtherwise, you're done repairing your car?\n\nDomino, I've changed my mind about the competition, I'm wondering if I really want to work in the Malian civil service, do I want to be a Customs Inspector for the next 30 - 40 years. What's more, part of me really wants to travel, maybe even settle in another country, but working in the civil service won't allow me to do that. What's more, the ENA entrance exam is held almost every year and the age limit is 43, so I've still got time, but for now I want to discover myself and learn to enjoy life!\n\nOh great, what was the animated film about? I recently saw F1 and Superman and enjoyed them both.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nLamine 🥀",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nReading your words, I felt a calmness. You didn’t just listen, you actually saw the way I’m handling Mazen for what it is. You’re right — people like him can drain the air out of a room if you let them, and the fact you noticed how I’m approaching it with patience means a lot. I’ve learned that not every battle is worth fighting head-on; sometimes it’s about keeping your peace intact and quietly stepping forward.\n\nAs for France… It’s more than just a passport or even fashion. It’s the rhythm of the streets, the way art is stitched into daily life, the feeling of history whispering through the walls of old buildings. I want to breathe that in. But I gotta say, I heard that French people might be mean, but that’s not true. They just don’t like the friendly way Americans like hi and how are you, have a good one, etc. Instead, they appreciate genuine relationships. I want to see for myself how people live there, how they carry themselves, how beauty is treated as something natural and not a luxury. Of course, fashion plays a role — it’s a language I’ve always wanted to speak fluently — but I think what draws me in most is the lifestyle itself. A balance between elegance, freedom, and maybe even a bit of rebellion.\n\nYour story about the Cyberpunk bar hit me in an interesting way. It’s proof that people can build spaces out of pure vision — an idea, a vibe, a dream, and suddenly it’s a reality others can step into. That’s the kind of creation I admire that deeply, and I want to be that person one day. It ties back to my own dream of building something that isn’t just functional but alive, something that reflects the soul of its creator.\n\nAnd yes — this does feel like a time capsule. These letters carry pieces of us, and one day, when we look back, it’ll be like opening a sealed jar of thoughts and emotions we once bottled up and sent across the distance. That’s the kind of thing I know will stay with me.\n\nTalk soon,\nMoni\n\nP.S. I’ve been putting together some plans for September—I’ll share the details with you in my next letter.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n读你的信，我感到一种平静。你不仅在听，你还真正看到了我处理Mazen的方式。你说得对——像他这样的人，如果任由他们，确实会把房间里的空气都吸光。你注意到我是以耐心的态度来应对的，这对我来说意义重大。我学到了，并不是每一场战斗都值得正面迎战；有时候，保持内心的平静，默默地向前走，才是关键。\n\n至于法国……这不仅仅是护照或时尚的问题。这是街道的节奏，艺术融入日常生活的形式，历史在古老建筑的墙壁中低语的感觉。我想去感受这一切。不过，我得说，虽然听说法国人可能不太友好，但事实并非如此。他们只是不喜欢美国人那种随意的问候方式，比如“你好”、“你怎么样”、“祝你一切顺利”等等。相反，他们更看重真诚的关系。我想亲眼看看那里的人们是如何生活的，他们如何自处，如何将美视为一种自然的存在而非奢侈品。当然，时尚也扮演着重要角色——这是一门我一直渴望流利掌握的语言——但最吸引我的，还是那种生活方式本身。一种优雅、自由，甚至带有一点叛逆的平衡。\n\n你关于赛博朋克酒吧的故事让我感到非常有趣。这证明了人们可以凭借纯粹的愿景来创造空间——一个想法、一种氛围、一个梦想，突然间它就变成了一个现实，其他人可以走进去。这种创造深深打动了我，我希望有一天也能成为这样的人。这与我自己的梦想息息相关，那就是建造一些不仅仅是功能性的，而是有生命力的东西，反映出创造者的灵魂。\n\n是的——这确实像一个时间胶囊。这些信件承载着我们的一部分，有一天，当我们回首往事时，就像打开一个曾经密封的罐子，里面装满了我们曾经封存并寄出的思想和情感。我知道，这将是我永远铭记的东西。\n\n改天聊，\nMoni\n\n附：我一直在为九月制定一些计划——我会在下一封信中与你分享详情。",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nAbout Mazen — I admire the way you’re handling it. Honestly, for your age, it’s rare to see someone think so clearly about both short-term survival and long-term vision. From my experience, a lot of people just drift through life, chasing nothing beyond next month’s bills. You’re already far ahead of many of your peers, and even older people, simply by knowing what you want and moving toward it.\n\nI also had my share of “Mazen types” back in my office job days. But I was a bit thorny, and strong enough in my work that while I wasn’t irreplaceable, replacing me would’ve been costly. In the end, those kinds of bosses usually didn’t last — one way or another, I found ways to push them out. It wasn’t always pretty, but it taught me that bad leadership eventually collapses on itself.\n\nYour vision for France struck me. The way you talk about timeless fashion, craftsmanship, even dreaming of starting your own brand — it’s rare to hear someone your age speak with that kind of passion. It reminds me of why I studied French at university, even though I never actually went to France. Sometimes the idea of a place can be just as powerful as the reality. I’d be curious to know, aside from the passport and the fashion, what else you’re most looking forward to experiencing there.\n\nAs for Qixi — I’ve more or less recovered by the time we went, so I could enjoy it properly. Between my boyfriend, my roommate, and me, I ended up being the only one who could really drink, so let’s just say a few hundred yuan vanished into cocktails. I’ll attach a couple of photos from the Cyberpunk bar so you can see the vibe for yourself. The owner’s passion really shows — he’s making money out of what he loves, and that’s something I admire. It even gave me some inspiration for my own future projects.\n\nAnd thank you for what you wrote at the end of your last letter. I don’t take those words lightly. I also feel lucky to have this connection — these letters are like little time capsules, and I know I’ll be glad to look back on them years from now.\n\nTalk soon,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n关于马赞——我非常钦佩你处理这件事的方式。老实说，以你的年龄，能看到有人如此清晰地思考短期生存和长期愿景，这实属罕见。从我的经验来看，很多人只是随波逐流，除了下个月的账单之外，几乎没有什么追求。你已经远远领先于许多同龄人，甚至比一些年长的人更胜一筹，仅仅是因为你知道自己想要什么，并且在朝着目标前进。\n\n在我过去的办公室工作中，我也遇到过不少“马赞类型”的人。但我有点棘手，工作能力也很强，虽然我不是不可替代的，但替换我将会付出高昂的代价。最终，这类老板通常不会长久——无论通过什么方式，我总能找到办法让他们离开。虽然过程并不总是那么美好，但这让我明白，糟糕的领导最终会自食其果。\n\n你对法国的愿景让我印象深刻。你谈到永恒的时尚、工艺，甚至梦想着创立自己的品牌——很少有人在你这个年纪能如此充满激情地谈论这些。这让我想起了为什么我在大学时学习法语，即使我从未真正去过法国。有时候，对一个地方的想象可以和现实一样强大。除了护照和时尚，你还最期待在法国体验什么？\n\n至于七夕——我们去的时候，我已经基本恢复了，所以能够好好享受。在男朋友、室友和我之间，最终只有我能真正喝酒，所以不妨说几百元都花在了鸡尾酒上。我会附上几张赛博朋克酒吧的照片，你可以自己感受一下那里的氛围。酒吧老板的热情真的展现无遗——他正在通过自己热爱的事情赚钱，这是我非常钦佩的。这也给了我一些未来项目的灵感。\n\n感谢你在上一封信末尾写的话。我不会轻视这些话。我也感到很幸运能有这种联系——这些信件就像一个个小小的时间胶囊，我知道多年后回顾它们会感到非常高兴。\n\n期待不久再聊，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nIt’s funny how a photo can suggest calm when the reality behind it is completely different. Knowing you had to set up quickly under that heat and humidity actually makes the picture more impressive — you managed to capture stillness despite the chaos around you.\n\nWhat you said about bullying struck me. You’re right — those experiences do leave a mark, but they also sharpen how we see and understand people. I think they give us both resilience and a deeper appreciation for kindness when we come across it. Like you said, it feels good to have finally put a full stop at the end of that chapter.\n\nOn another note, I’ve been dealing with this manager named Mazen, and honestly, he’s been testing everyone’s nerves. He talks down to people, acts like he’s carrying the whole operation, and dismisses any input that doesn’t fit his own ideas. He even sent a long message basically declaring that no one should bother suggesting anything new because “it’s too late.” And if that wasn’t enough, he went the extra mile telling the whole team to either go with his way or resign. Imagine hearing that from someone who’s supposed to be a leader. I’d quit right now if I could, but with university and moving out on the horizon, saving up has to come first. So for now, I’ll just watch where his little game goes and hold on until December before deciding my next step. I’ve promised myself, though, that in the company I build one day, people like Mazen won’t flourish — only those with the right morals, the kind who lead with respect and integrity, will ever have a place there.\n\nAs for France, what excites me goes beyond the passport. I’m a huge fan of classic fashion, and I feel like France is one of the last countries that still embraces it fully. Just the thought of walking down the street and seeing well-tailored suits, blazers, long coats — clothing that carries real elegance and craftsmanship — inspires me. Watches, ties, men’s and women’s wear alike, all done with a timeless touch. One of my dreams is to create my own brand one day, making pieces that are the absolute best in quality while still being accessible to regular people. I know it sounds a bit romanticized, but for me it’s not just about clothes, it’s about preserving a style of living that feels both refined and enduring. And, for a somewhat silly reason, finishing Sonic Unleashed earlier this year also made me really drawn to France — the whole vibe of Spagonia, the streets, the music, it just somehow stuck with me and made me want to experience something similar in real life.\n\nYour Qixi plans sound like a lot of fun — the Cyberpunk bar in particular feels like the perfect backdrop for some memorable stories. I hope you’re feeling fully recovered by then so you can enjoy it to the fullest.\n\nLooking forward to your next photos,\nMoni\n\nP.S. I’m truly thankful for fate letting me get to know someone like you. It’s rare to meet people who bring a sense of connection and understanding, and I feel lucky that our paths crossed.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n真有趣，一张照片竟能传达出平静，而背后的现实却截然不同。知道你在那样的高温和湿度下迅速布置场景，反而让这张照片更加令人印象深刻——你成功地捕捉到了宁静，尽管周围一片混乱。\n\n你提到的欺凌问题让我深有感触。你说得对，这些经历确实会留下痕迹，但它们也磨砺了我们对人性的理解和洞察。我认为，这些经历赋予了我们韧性，也让我们更加珍视遇到的善意。正如你所说，终于为这一章节画上了句号，感觉真好。\n\n另外，我最近在和一个叫Mazen的经理打交道，老实说，他真的在考验每个人的耐心。他居高临下地对人说话，自以为在支撑整个运营，对任何不符合他想法的建议都嗤之以鼻。他还发了一条长消息，基本上宣布没有人应该再提出新建议，因为“已经太晚了”。更过分的是，他还告诉整个团队要么按他的方式行事，要么辞职。想象一下，从一个本应是领导的人那里听到这样的话。如果可以的话，我现在就会辞职，但考虑到大学和搬出去的事情，我还需要先存点钱。所以，目前我只能观察他的小把戏，坚持到十二月再决定下一步。不过，我发誓，将来我创建的公司里，像Mazen这样的人不会有机会发展——只有那些有正确道德观，以尊重和正直领导的人，才能在这里有一席之地。\n\n至于法国，让我兴奋的不仅仅是护照。我是个经典时尚的狂热爱好者，我觉得法国是少数几个仍然完全拥抱这种风格的国家之一。想象一下走在街上，看到精心裁剪的西装、夹克、长外套——这些衣物都散发着真正的优雅和工艺，真是令人振奋。手表、领带、男女装，都充满了永恒的韵味。我有一个梦想，就是有一天能创建自己的品牌，制作出最高品质的单品，同时让普通人也能负担得起。我知道这听起来有些浪漫化，但对我来说，这不仅仅是关于衣服，而是关于一种既精致又持久的生活方式。而且，出于一个有点傻的原因，今年早些时候玩完《索尼克：解放》后，我对法国也产生了浓厚的兴趣——Spagonia的氛围、街道、音乐，这一切都让我想在现实生活中体验类似的感觉。\n\n你的七夕计划听起来很有趣，尤其是那个赛博朋克酒吧，感觉会是一个充满回忆的背景。希望到那时你已经完全恢复，可以尽情享受。\n\n期待你的下一张照片，\nMoni\n\n附：我真心感谢命运让我认识了你这样的人。遇到能带来连接和理解的人是很难得的，我感到很幸运我们的路途能交汇。",

My editing is actually quite rough; I usually just adjust the light and colors a bit and call it done. As for whether I have a “best shot”… nothing comes to mind right away. Maybe that photo is still waiting for me somewhere in the future.\n\nGood news: my lens has been repaired, and I’m picking it up tomorrow. The bad news: the repair cost was about one-fifth of the price of the lens 😮‍💨. At least with my car, I didn’t have to pay anything.\n\nI’m really sorry to hear about the situation in Mali. It must feel discouraging at times, but I hope the exam goes as smoothly as possible for you. Fingers crossed.\n\nRecently I watched a Chinese animated film that left quite an impression on me.

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nAbout that photo — it actually wasn’t as relaxed as it might have looked. Summer hadn’t fully passed yet, the temperature was high, and the typhoon had just left the air heavy and damp. I was sweating almost the whole time, set up quickly, took a few shots, and packed it all back up. Hardly the dreamy seaside moment it may have seemed.\n\nI’m sorry to hear about the story you shared with your old bully. Some friends of mine have gone through similar things, and it always leaves its mark. Maybe it does make people a little more introverted, a little sharper in how they observe the world. At least it sounds like you’ve managed to close that chapter properly — a “proper full stop,” so to speak. Hopefully, no more bullying in schools anywhere.\n\nI don’t keep in touch with many childhood classmates either. Only a handful remain, and even then the contact is loose. Sometimes I think it makes me sound a bit ruthless, but the truth is I’ve never been good at lingering in the past. Still, I admire your friend pursuing aerospace engineering in the US — that kind of dedication and focus isn’t something everyone has.\n\nYour exchange route is impressively clear. I admire your drive. An EU passport really is powerful — meanwhile, with a Chinese passport, so many places still require visas, which is both time-consuming and expensive. Back in university I studied French, but ironically I’ve never actually been to France. I do wonder whether the country still carries the same elegance and ease it’s famous for, or if it’s changed in ways that would surprise me. What is it about France, apart from the passport, that excites you most?\n\nThis week is Qixi Festival here — sort of like our version of Valentine’s Day. My boyfriend (yes, he’s finally coming back from his parents’ place) and I, along with one of my roommates, are planning a two-day trip to a nearby city. There’s a bar there themed after Cyberpunk 2077 — the video game — and it looks pretty wild. I want to go and drink far too much just for the atmosphere. The only problem is my respiratory system has been acting up lately — I’m not sure if it’s just a cold or COVID. Either way, I’ve already started on medicine and I’m hoping to be fully recovered before the bar night.\n\nTalk soon — I’ll try to send more photos next time,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n关于那张照片——其实并没有看起来那么轻松。夏天还没有完全过去，气温很高，台风刚过，空气又闷又湿。我几乎一直在出汗，匆匆忙忙地搭好设备，拍了几张照片，然后又赶紧收起来。根本不是那种梦幻的海边时刻。\n\n听到你和那个老欺负你的同学的故事，我感到很遗憾。我的一些朋友也经历过类似的事情，这总是会留下一些痕迹。也许这确实会让人变得稍微内向一些，对世界的观察也更加敏锐。至少听你这么说，你已经妥善地结束了那一章——用一个“完美的句号”。希望学校里再也没有欺凌。\n\n我也不怎么和儿时的同学保持联系。只有少数几个，而且联系也很松散。有时候我觉得这让我听起来有点无情，但事实是我从来都不擅长停留在过去。不过，我还是很佩服你的朋友在美国追求航空航天工程——这种专注和毅力不是每个人都能做到的。\n\n你的交换路线真的很清晰。我佩服你的决心。欧盟护照确实很强大——相比之下，中国护照去很多地方还需要签证，既耗时又费钱。大学时我学过法语，但讽刺的是，我从未去过法国。我很好奇，法国是否仍然保持着它著名的优雅和轻松，或者是否已经发生了让我惊讶的变化。除了护照，法国最吸引你的地方是什么？\n\n这周是中国的情人节——七夕节。我男朋友（是的，他终于从他父母家回来了）和我，还有我的一个室友，计划去附近的一个城市玩两天。那里有一家以《赛博朋克2077》为主题的酒吧，看起来非常酷。我想去那里，为了气氛喝得酩酊大醉。唯一的问题是最近我的呼吸系统有点问题——不确定是感冒还是新冠。不管怎样，我已经开始吃药了，希望在酒吧之夜前完全恢复。\n\n改天再聊——下次我会多发一些照片的，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nYour message made me smile — it felt like a cozy fireside chat, complete with owls and windswept beaches.\n\nI totally get the Hedwig effect! That snowy fluffball made owls iconic for an entire generation. And Yoll — I haven't seen any content for it before, but when I did that owl too, with those impossibly expressive eyes. It’s funny how animals can feel so familiar even when we only meet them through screens. I wish the pet laws were more flexible where you are — I imagine an owl perched quietly nearby would suit you quite well.\n\nYou nailed it with the Instax Mini Evo. It is indeed an instant camera, and I love the idea of capturing moments without fussing over settings. But your point about creative limitations is spot-on. I’ve been leaning toward something that lets me capture the moment with that dreamy Polaroid effect, so maybe an instant camera is enough for me. Thanks for the nudge — I needed that.\n\nAnd wow — I didn’t realize that was you in the photo! You pulled off the solo beach shoot like a pro. I can picture you trudging through the sand with all that gear, determined to get the shot. That kind of effort says a lot about your passion — and your stamina.\n\nI don’t think you’re cold at all. Life moves, and not everyone stays in our orbit. I’ve lost touch with all of my childhood friends too except for my best friend hes doing well now he went to the united states and is entering uni soon to study aero space enginerring im so proud of him hes the only person from my past who liked me for who i am and I’ve come to see it as natural. Some people are meant to be chapters, not constants. Still, I admire your friends pursuing PhDs — that kind of dedication is rare,\nI have a story related to this topic. A former contact of mine (bully) reached out to me in my DMs. He just sent me my name, and I didn't recognize him until he introduced himself. I felt annoyed inside but brushed it off and greeted him warmly, as if he were an old friend reaching back. I played along, but each message he sent was an insult in disguise. I was patient for three or four messages until I asked why he was reaching out all of a sudden. Of course, he got defensive, claiming we were old friends and he just wanted to reconnect. I recognized his tone—similar to years ago—and knew he was trying to play mind games, which I refused to give him the satisfaction of. I stayed calm but stood my ground, telling him directly that I remembered how he treated me before and that his words didn't show genuine intent to reconnect. He went quiet for a while, then tried to dismiss it with a laugh, implying I was overreacting. This guy made my life hell when I was in high school back in my home country. I didn't take the bait and left him on read, going silent. It wasn't the best move on my part, but I drew the line. He kept messaging me for two days, asking for a chance to explain, and I said, Okay, now’s your chance. We then had a surprisingly sincere conversation. It was just his usual rude writing style. I should have kept my composure more; I listened to what he had to say. He didn't apologize for the past, but that was okay. He seemed to be trying to become a better person, which felt like closure for me. He said he was reaching out to his old contacts for mutual benefits, which I didn't expect, but I agreed if that was his view. We parted ways peacefully, although it felt like finishing unfinished business from the past.\n\nIt’s reassuring to hear you speak so kindly about your own journey. Even if the last few years weren’t perfect, it sounds like you’ve built a solid foundation. And thank you for your words about love — they genuinely comforted me. I’m learning to trust my own timing, even if it doesn’t match the world’s pace.\n\nThe university I’m aiming for is in France, but realistically, I will attend Alexandria University for now until I prepare all the documents and a plan. Once I’m ready, I will transfer to France as an exchange student, and there is a way I can get a job when I arrive. It feels surreal — like standing at the edge of something vast and unknown. But I hear you asking why France specifically. Well, it’s one of the easiest European countries to obtain their citizenship. I’m not interested in citizenship itself, but rather the passport, which allows visa-free travel to 194 countries, almost all the countries in the world, making the odyssey far more feasible. Also, wages in France are high, so working there alongside my studies could help me save a considerable amount of money for the journey. French universities are very affordable—around 180 euros per semester. I imagine starting the odyssey romantically after finishing university, but realistically, perhaps in my late 20s. It still has some romance, but I don’t want to do it as an old man! That’s my current plan, but if you have any ideas to improve it, let me know. If you come up with a good idea, I’d love to add it to the plan.\n\nCan’t wait to hear more from you — your letters always feel like a breath of fresh air.\n\nYour friend,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n你的消息让我笑了——感觉就像是一次温暖的炉边聊天，还有猫头鹰和风中的海滩。\n\n我完全理解“海德薇效应”！那个雪白的毛球让猫头鹰成为了一代人的标志性形象。至于 Yoll——我之前没见过它的内容，但当我看到那只猫头鹰时，它那不可思议的表达力真的让人印象深刻。有趣的是，即使我们只是通过屏幕认识这些动物，它们也能让我们感到如此亲切。真希望你那里的宠物法规能更宽松一些——想象一下，一只安静的猫头鹰陪伴在你身边，一定很适合你。\n\n你对 Instax Mini Evo 的评价太准确了。它确实是一台即时相机，我喜欢那种无需调整设置就能捕捉瞬间的感觉。但你提到的创意限制确实很有道理。我最近也在倾向于能捕捉瞬间并带有梦幻宝丽来效果的相机，所以也许一台即时相机就足够了。谢谢你的建议——我正需要这个。\n\n哇——没想到照片中的人是你！你独自在海滩上拍摄，看起来像专业人士。我仿佛能看到你拖着所有设备在沙滩上行走，决心拍到完美的照片。这种努力真的展示了你的热情和耐力。\n\n我不认为你冷淡。生活总是变化的，不是每个人都能一直留在我们的生活圈里。我与童年时的朋友也失去了联系，除了我最好的朋友。他现在在美国，即将进入大学学习航空航天工程，我为他感到非常骄傲。他是唯一一个喜欢真实的我的人，我逐渐接受了这一点，认为这是自然的。有些人注定只是生活中的一个章节，而不是永恒的存在。不过，我仍然钦佩你的朋友们在追求博士学位——这种专注和毅力非常难得。\n\n我有一个与此相关的故事。一个以前的熟人（霸凌者）在私信中联系了我。他只发了我的名字，直到他自我介绍后我才认出他。我内心感到很不悦，但还是礼貌地回应了他，仿佛他是多年未见的老朋友。我配合着，但每条消息都像是隐含的侮辱。我忍了三四条消息后，问他为什么突然联系我。他变得很防御，声称我们是老朋友，只是想重新联系。我认出了他的语气——和多年前一样——知道他在玩心理游戏，我拒绝给他这种满足。我保持冷静，但坚定地告诉他，我记得他以前是如何对待我的，他的言辞并没有表现出真诚的重新联系的意图。他沉默了一会儿，然后试图用笑声敷衍，暗示我反应过度。这个人在高中时让我在家乡的生活变得非常痛苦。我没有上当，只是不再回复他，保持沉默。这可能不是最好的处理方式，但我划清了界限。他连续两天不停地发消息，请求给我解释的机会，我说，好吧，现在你有机会了。我们随后进行了一次出乎意料的真诚对话。他的语气还是像往常一样粗鲁。我应该保持更多的冷静，但还是听了他说的话。他没有为过去的所作所为道歉，但没关系。他似乎在努力成为一个更好的人，这对我来说已经是一种解脱。他说他联系旧朋友是为了互相帮助，这是我没想到的，但我也同意了他的看法。我们和平地结束了对话，虽然感觉像是完成了过去的未竟之事。\n\n听到你如此善意地谈论自己的旅程，真让人感到安慰。即使过去的几年并不完美，但听起来你已经打下了坚实的基础。感谢你关于爱的话语——它们真的让我感到安慰。我正在学习按照自己的节奏去信任，即使这与世界的步伐不同。\n\n我目标的大学在法国，但现实情况是，我将先就读亚历山大大学，直到准备好所有文件和计划。一旦准备就绪，我将作为交换生转学到法国，并且有一条途径可以在到达后找到工作。这感觉很不真实——就像站在一片广阔未知的边缘。但你问为什么是法国。法国是欧洲最容易获得公民身份的国家之一。我并不特别在意公民身份本身，而是更在意护照，它允许免签进入194个国家，几乎是全世界的国家，这让我的旅程变得更加可行。此外，法国的工资很高，所以一边学习一边工作可以帮我节省一大笔钱。法国的大学学费非常低廉——每学期大约180欧元。我想象着在大学毕业后浪漫地开始我的旅程，但现实可能是等到我30岁左右。这仍然有一些浪漫，但我不想等到年纪太大。这是我的当前计划，如果你有任何改进的建议，请告诉我。如果你有好主意，我非常愿意将其加入计划。\n\n期待你的更多来信——你的信总是像一阵清新的空气。\n\n你的朋友，\n莫妮",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nI actually really like owls too — but here in China, the list of animals you can legally keep as pets is very, very limited, and sadly owls aren’t on it. My first interest in them probably came from Harry Potter (yes, Hedwig completely stole my heart). Later I came across a Russian owl named Yoll online — also impossibly cute. This is my first time hearing that “owl” can be used to describe introverts in Arabic. Another little piece of Egypt knowledge for me, haha.\n\nAbout the Instax Mini Evo — is it a kind of instant camera, like a Polaroid? If so, I think it could be a good choice. The beauty of instant cameras is that you don’t have to obsess over settings, but the tradeoff is they’re less flexible with focal lengths or creative techniques. If your goal is simply to preserve memories beautifully, then yes — go for it. But if you’re curious about exploring photography more deeply, maybe consider starting with an entry-level mirrorless camera.\n\nAs for that blonde guy in the photo — that was me. 😅 Like I mentioned, my boyfriend had to head back home midway through the trip, so at the coast it was just me and my car. And since I didn’t dare drive it onto the sand (imagine getting stuck there…), I ended up hauling all the gear myself — camera, tripod, and even two camping chairs — down to the beach for the shoot. Quite the workout.\n\nAbout childhood friends — honestly, I don’t keep in touch with most of mine either. Maybe I’m a little cold? Or maybe I’m just not used to lingering in the past. Right now I’m still in contact with only two or three classmates from middle/high school. Two of them are still pursuing PhDs — they’re pretty committed, I guess. They have their own path to follow.\n\nI’m glad you saw my study path in such a positive light :D I think that period of my life was when I made the most “right” decisions so far. The last few years… not quite as good, to be honest.\n\nAs for love — don’t worry about not having had a relationship yet. My first one didn’t happen until after I graduated from university. Everyone has their own rhythm; there’s nothing urgent about it.\n\nBy the way, is the university you’re preparing for in France? And when do you think you’ll officially begin your Odyssey?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n其实我也非常喜欢猫头鹰——但在中国，可以合法养作宠物的动物种类非常有限，遗憾的是猫头鹰并不在其中。我对猫头鹰的兴趣最初可能来自《哈利·波特》（是的，海德薇完全俘获了我的心）。后来我在网上遇到了一只俄罗斯的猫头鹰尤尔——同样可爱得不可思议。这是我第一次听说在阿拉伯语中“猫头鹰”可以用来形容内向的人。对我来说，这又是一个小小的埃及知识，哈哈。\n\n关于那台Instax Mini Evo——它是不是像宝丽来那样的即时相机？如果是的话，我认为它可能是一个不错的选择。即时相机的魅力在于你不必过于纠结于设置，但缺点是它们在焦距或创意技巧方面不够灵活。如果你的目标只是美丽地保存回忆，那么当然——就选它吧。但如果你对更深入地探索摄影感兴趣，或许可以考虑从一台入门级的无反相机开始。\n\n至于照片中的那个金发男生——那就是我。😅正如我提到的，我的男朋友在旅行中途不得不回家，所以在海边的时候只有我和我的车。由于我不敢把车开上沙滩（想象一下被困在那里……），我最终不得不自己把所有设备——相机、三脚架，甚至两把露营椅——搬到海滩上进行拍摄。真是相当不错的锻炼。\n\n关于童年朋友——老实说，我也很少和大多数童年朋友保持联系。也许我有点冷淡？或者我只是不习惯停留在过去。现在我仍然和中学或高中的两三个同学保持联系。其中两个还在攻读博士学位——他们相当执着，我想。他们有自己的路要走。\n\n很高兴你对我的学习路径有如此积极的看法 :D 我觉得那段时间是我生活中做出最“正确”决定的时期。最近几年……说实话，不是那么好。\n\n至于爱情——不要担心还没有经历过恋爱。我的第一次恋爱是在大学毕业后才发生的。每个人都有自己的节奏；这没有什么急迫的。\n\n对了，你准备申请的大学在法国吗？你认为你的奥德赛之旅什么时候会正式开始？\n\n期待听到更多，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\nReading your letter felt like opening a window into your world—quietly vivid, layered with experience, and full of thoughtfulness. I appreciate how much you shared, and I have to say, I’m still left wanting to know more. You’ve lived through so many shifts, and yet there’s a calm clarity in how you speak about it all. It’s rare.\n\nYour comment about Debbie’s “successor” made me smile, even if it was a bit cruel. I understand—cats are complicated, and having two at once can feel like inviting chaos into the house. Having just one cat seems like a sensible choice. Seeing Debbie’s photo was cute, almost like catching a glimpse of your world—there’s something grounding about seeing the animals that influence our daily lives. I'm thinking about getting an owl someday because I find them poetically resonant. In Arabic, being called an owl means you’re acting too much like an introvert, and your posture resembles the nervous stand you do when you’re anxious. I was often called out for that while growing up.\n\nYour trip to the sea clearly left a mark, and I’m glad my words resonated with that. There’s something timeless about the ocean, isn’t there? It doesn’t just reflect our moods—it absorbs them. I hope your travel list keeps growing, and that each destination brings not just stories, but new versions of yourself.\nAnd the view of the trip was beautiful, skyscrapers in the background of the sea. I really need to get some pointers from you, my guy. I was never into photography, but now I want to make it one of my hobbies. I'm thinking of getting the Instax Mini Evo, it offers both the aesthetics and functionality I'm chasing as a beginner. If you have recommendations for beginner cameras, enlighten me right away. Also, was that blonde guy your boyfriend or yours?\n\nYour filmmaking journey is fascinating. That middle-school documentary crew sounds like a beautiful mess—chaotic, yes, but also formative. It’s strange how the things we create early on, even if they vanish, still shape us. Losing those videos must’ve been tough, but I admire how you’ve reframed it. Maybe it really was life nudging you forward, reminding you not to get stuck in nostalgia. Even though I'm guilty myself, I tend to daydream about my childhood friends and what happened to them now. \n\nYour path through high school and university feels familiar in its unpredictability. That tension between wanting to break free and choosing to stay the course—it’s something I think many of us wrestle with. I respect your decision to pursue French broadcasting and how you found ways to stay close to the media even when the system didn’t fully align with your spirit. Freelancing through an ad agency, working with car brands, growing from editing to shooting—it’s clear you’ve built your skills with intention. And now, living off freelance projects, even if it’s not your ideal, shows a kind of quiet resilience.\nI really appreciated your advice about university. I’m about to step into that world, and your words felt like a compass. “Let your choices be yours alone”—that hit deep. It’s easy to get swept up in what looks prestigious or important, especially when everyone’s chasing something. I’ll keep your warning about student unions in mind. I don’t know how things will unfold here, but I’ll try to stay true to what feels real and meaningful.\n\nYour description of campus life was beautiful. It reminded me that university isn’t just about academics—it’s about becoming. Trying, failing, connecting, disconnecting, falling in love, starting things, letting go. I’ll carry that with me.\n\nAs for your relationship, I hear you. Being apart now and then is one thing, but noticing patterns that don’t sit right—that’s something else. I hope you find the clarity you need, whether through conversation or reflection. Relationships are rarely simple, and it takes courage to face the parts that feel off.\nI'm speaking like someone who knows what they're saying, but I've never had a romantic relationship before. How ironic, I hear you say, haha\n\nThank you again for writing with such openness. I feel like I’ve gotten more glimpses of your world, but I’d love to know more—what you dream about, what keeps you up at night, what you’re still searching for. I’ll be here, listening. If you also want to have a glimpse of my world, ask right  away, a good conversation goes both ways\n\nUntil next time, friend,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n读你的信就像打开了一扇通往你世界的窗户——静静地生动，充满经历，饱含深意。我很感激你分享了这么多，但说实话，我还是想了解更多。你经历了这么多变化，但你谈论这一切时却有一种平静的清晰，这很难得。\n\n你提到Debbie的“继任者”时让我笑了，尽管有点残酷。我理解——猫确实很复杂，同时养两只猫就像把混乱请进了家门。养一只猫似乎是个明智的选择。看到Debbie的照片很可爱，就像瞥见了你的世界一角——看到那些影响我们日常生活的动物，总有一种踏实的感觉。我一直在考虑养一只猫头鹰，因为我觉得它们很有诗意。在阿拉伯语中，被称作猫头鹰意味着你太内向了，你的姿态就像你焦虑时那种紧张的站立姿势。我小时候经常被这样指责。\n\n你的海边之旅显然给你留下了深刻的印象，我很高兴我的话能与之共鸣。海洋有一种永恒的魅力，不是吗？它不仅反映我们的情绪，还吸收它们。希望你的旅行清单不断增长，每个目的地不仅带来故事，还带来新的自我。\n那次旅行的照片也很美，背景是高楼大厦，前面是大海。我真需要向你请教一些摄影技巧。我以前对摄影不感兴趣，但现在我想把它作为我的一个爱好。我正在考虑买一台Instax Mini Evo，它既有我追求的美学，又有功能。如果你有适合初学者的相机推荐，一定要告诉我。还有，那个金发的男生是你的男朋友吗？\n\n你的电影制作之旅非常吸引人。那个中学纪录片团队听起来像是一场美丽的混乱——混乱，但也是成长的一部分。奇怪的是，我们早期创作的东西，即使消失了，仍然在塑造我们。失去那些视频一定很难，但我佩服你重新看待这件事的方式。也许生活真的在推动你前进，提醒你不要沉溺于怀旧。尽管我自己也常常这样，但我喜欢幻想我的童年朋友现在怎么样了。\n\n你高中和大学的经历在不可预测中显得熟悉。那种想要摆脱束缚和选择坚持之间的张力，我想很多人都在与之斗争。我尊重你选择法语广播，并找到了在媒体中保持接近的方法，即使系统并不完全符合你的精神。通过广告公司自由职业，与汽车品牌合作，从剪辑到拍摄的成长——很明显，你有意图地构建了自己的技能。现在，即使这不是你的理想状态，但靠自由职业项目生活，也显示出一种安静的坚韧。\n我真的很感激你关于大学的建议。我即将踏入那个世界，你的话就像一个指南针。“让你的选择成为你自己的选择”——这句话深深打动了我。很容易被那些看起来有声望或重要的东西所吸引，尤其是当每个人都追求某些东西时。我会记住你关于学生会的警告。我不知道这里的情况会如何发展，但我会努力保持真实和有意义。\n\n你对校园生活的描述很美。这让我想起，大学不仅仅是学术——它是关于成长。尝试、失败、连接、断开、坠入爱河、开始事情、放手。我会带着这些去大学。\n\n至于你的关系，我理解你的感受。偶尔分开是一回事，但注意到那些让你不舒服的模式是另一回事。希望你能找到你需要的清晰，无论是通过对话还是反思。关系很少是简单的，面对那些让你感到不对劲的部分需要勇气。\n我听起来像是个懂行的人，但我从未有过浪漫关系。多么讽刺，是吧，哈哈。\n\n再次感谢你如此坦诚地写信。我觉得我看到了更多你的世界，但还想了解更多——你梦想什么，什么让你夜不能寐，你还在寻找什么。我会在这里，倾听。如果你也想看看我的世界，随时告诉我，好的对话是双向的。\n\n下次见，朋友，\nMoni",

    "content": "Hi Lamine 🤗\n\nThank you for your kind words about my photos! The camera I use is a Sony A7M4. But honestly, compared to shooting with a phone, the main difference isn’t just “quality” — it’s that the camera gives me more information and room to adjust afterwards. Post-processing is half the work. So what you saw in the photos had a bit of my “magic” added; in real life the scenes might not have looked quite as cool 🌚.\n\nSpeaking of cameras… I managed to drop mine during a work shoot a couple of days ago. One of my lenses seems to have a slightly bent mount now. Tomorrow I’ll take it to be repaired — sigh, another unexpected expense. 😮‍💨\n\nOn the bright side, something good happened too: a few nights ago my car got scratched by another driver. It was his fault, so he covered the repair — and while fixing that, the shop also took care of an older dent for free. So at least my car looks refreshed now.\n\nIt seems like no matter which country you’re in, finding a job is always tough 😮‍💨. Civil service exams do sound like a solid path though. Good luck, good luck — I’ll be rooting for you on August 31!\n\nAnd I finally listened to Bambara — it really is fascinating, a language completely outside the families I’m familiar with. I didn’t understand a single word 🤦‍♂️, but that’s exactly what makes it so interesting. As for your voice, it’s perfectly fine! Don’t put yourself down — I actually enjoyed hearing it.\n\nTake care, and write soon,\nDomino 🌿",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nAbout Debbie’s “successor” — I think that’ll only happen after his time is up. Sounds a bit cruel, I know, but I’m not really a fan of raising two cats at once. I always imagine they’d fight, so for now it’s one cat at a time.\n\nThank you for resonating with my trip to the sea. My travel list is still very, very long, and I’m sure I’ll find ways to reach more places in the future. Hopefully with more good stories involved.\n\nSince you asked, here’s the rough path of my career:\nBack in middle school, I first found my love for filmmaking. I used to play around with miniDVs and CCD cameras, shooting little vlog-style videos, and even roped in my classmates to make a short “documentary” about my hometown. (Middle-school film crew… it was more chaos than cinema.) Side note — all of those videos vanished in a NAS disaster years later. No backups, nothing. Maybe it was life’s way of telling me not to stare too long into the rearview mirror. Anyway, from that time on, I felt certain I’d make filmmaking my profession.\n\nHigh school wasn’t easy — I disliked studying and almost dropped out to start a business. In the end, I chose to go to university, majoring in French broadcasting, which at least kept me tied to media. During my first two years, I began freelancing in video post-production, mostly through an ad agency that worked with car companies like Honda. By senior year, during my internship, I finally got my hands on professional cameras, and my skills grew from pure editing into both shooting and cutting.\n\nAfter several jobs, my work expanded to include social media operations, which pulled me deeper into marketing. By now I’ve stepped away from office life, but the skills I’ve gathered allow me to live off freelance projects — shooting, editing, and running campaigns. It’s sustainable, but not my ideal. I suspect I’ll eventually choose to start my own thing.\n\nNow, back to university — first of all, congratulations on becoming a student soon 🎉! From my experience, the one thing that’s non-negotiable is: let your choices be yours alone. I don’t know how it works on your side of the Indian Ocean, but in China, student unions are… honestly, not worth the time. They sell themselves as growth and responsibility, but mostly it’s just volunteering for the school while chasing a vague sense of prestige. What is worth it: university life itself. For many, it’s the first time living away from family for years, which makes it the perfect place to test and grow self-discipline, independence, and social skills.\n\nThe campus can embrace nearly anything: study whatever excites you, meet whoever you want, try things that might look a little crazy, fall in love, navigate relationships, start a project (or fail one). These are things you may never get the chance to do again before or after those years. Don’t waste them on someone else’s agenda.\n\nAs for me, life is mostly steady, though my boyfriend and I are apart now and then. That part’s fine, but lately I’ve been thinking about some of his patterns — he can be a little too childish sometimes. I’m debating whether it’s time to sit down and talk it through.\n\nOh, and I finally got approval to send photos. I can only attach four per letter, so this time I’m sending a few from my last trip — and, of course, one of Debbie.\n\nUntil next time,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n关于黛比的“接班人”——我想这只有在他寿终正寝之后才会发生。听起来可能有点残忍，我知道，但我真的不太喜欢同时养两只猫。我总是想象它们会打架，所以现在还是一个一个来吧。\n\n谢谢你对我的海边之旅产生共鸣。我的旅行清单还很长很长，我相信未来我会找到更多到达新地方的方法，希望能有更多美好的故事相伴。\n\n既然你问起，这是我的职业生涯大致路径：\n中学时，我第一次发现了对电影制作的热爱。我过去常玩迷你DV和CCD相机，拍摄一些类似vlog的小视频，甚至拉上同学制作了一部关于我家乡的短“纪录片”。（中学电影团队……更多的是混乱而非电影。）顺便说一句，那些视频后来在一次NAS灾难中全部消失了。没有备份，什么都没有。也许是生活告诉我不要过多回顾过去。无论如何，从那时起，我确信电影制作将成为我的职业。\n\n高中并不容易——我不喜欢学习，差点辍学去创业。最终，我选择了上大学，主修法语广播，至少这让我与媒体保持联系。在大学的前两年，我开始兼职做视频后期制作，主要是通过一家与本田等汽车公司合作的广告公司。到大四实习时，我终于有机会使用专业摄像机，我的技能从单纯的剪辑扩展到了拍摄和剪辑。\n\n经过几份工作后，我的工作范围扩大到包括社交媒体运营，这让我更深入地进入了营销领域。现在我已离开办公室生活，但所学的技能让我能够靠自由职业项目生活——拍摄、剪辑和运营活动。这很稳定，但并非我的理想状态。我怀疑最终会选择自己创业。\n\n现在回到大学——首先，恭喜你即将成为一名学生🎉！根据我的经验，最重要的一点是：让你的选择真正属于你自己。我不知道在印度洋那边的情况如何，但在中国，学生会……老实说，不值得花时间。他们自诩为成长和责任，但大多数时候只是为学校做义工，追求一种模糊的荣誉感。真正值得的是大学生活本身。对许多人来说，这是第一次离开家庭生活多年，是测试和培养自律、独立和社会技能的完美场所。\n\n校园可以包容几乎所有事物：学习你感兴趣的任何东西，认识你想认识的任何人，尝试一些可能看起来有点疯狂的事情，恋爱，处理关系，开始一个项目（或失败一个）。这些是你在那些年之前或之后可能再也没有机会做的事情。不要把时间浪费在别人的议程上。\n\n至于我，生活还算平稳，虽然我和男朋友有时会分开。这没问题，但最近我在思考他的一些行为模式——他有时会显得有点太孩子气。我在考虑是否是时候坐下来好好谈谈了。\n\n哦，我终于得到了寄照片的许可。每次只能附带四张照片，所以这次我寄几张上次旅行的照片——当然，还有一张黛比的照片。\n\n下次再聊，\n多米诺",

I’ve approved your request in the app, so send those photos whenever Debbie’s in the mood to pose (or at least tolerate the camera). I’m especially curious to see the coast through your eyes — I imagine it must’ve felt like a homecoming of sorts. Einstein would be a bold follow-up, though I suspect Debbie might sabotage the audition process lol.\n\nYour words about the sea really struck me. That idea of the body remembering before the mind does… It’s beautiful and strangely comforting. I hope you experience more of those moments — they sound healing.\n\nI wanted to ask more about your career, if you don’t mind sharing. You always write with such clarity and depth — I’m curious about the kind of work you do and how you found your way into it. Was it something you always knew you’d pursue, or did it surprise you?\n\nI’m about to start university soon — probably in January or February — and I’m both excited and a little nervous.

But I’ve found my own sparks in other places, even if they come without the caffeine kick.\n\nIt sounds like life is in a quieter phase for you right now, and honestly, that can be a gift. Space to breathe, reflect, and maybe even enjoy Debbie’s antics without too much chaos. I hope your boyfriend’s work settles soon so you two can reunite — distance is tough, but it sounds like you’re handling it with grace.\n\nLooking forward to your photos and more stories soon.\n\nYour friend,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n我还在为黛比活出他的名字这个想法而笑——我感觉他已经有了一个让事情变得有趣的个性。我已经在应用里批准了你的请求，所以黛比什么时候愿意摆姿势（或者至少容忍相机）时，随时发照片给我吧。我特别好奇想看看你眼中的海岸线——我想象那一定像是一种归来的感受。爱因斯坦会是一个大胆的后续选择，不过我怀疑黛比可能会破坏试镜过程，哈哈。\n\n你关于大海的话真的触动了我。身体在大脑之前记住某些东西……这个想法既美丽又令人感到奇怪的安慰。我希望你能经历更多这样的时刻——它们听起来很治愈。\n\n我还想多了解一下你的职业，如果你不介意分享的话。你总是写得那么清晰而深刻——我很好奇你做的工作是什么，你是如何找到这条路的。这是你一直以来都知道要追求的吗，还是让你感到意外？\n\n我即将开始大学生活——可能在一月或二月——我既兴奋又有点紧张。我非常想听听你有什么建议，或者你最清晰记得的大学时光是什么。我应该期待什么？什么帮助你茁壮成长？\n\n是的，咖啡过敏确实很悲剧。我羡慕你的那些小仪式——光是那香味就足以让我感到怀旧。不过我在其他地方也找到了自己的火花，即使它们没有咖啡因的刺激。\n\n听起来你现在的生活进入了一个较为平静的阶段，老实说，这其实是一种礼物。有空间去呼吸、反思，甚至享受黛比的淘气，而不会有太多混乱。希望你男朋友的工作能尽快稳定下来，你们可以团聚——距离确实很难熬，但听起来你处理得很好。\n\n期待你的照片和更多故事。\n\n你的朋友，\n莫妮",

He’s my British Shorthair pet cat, a boy, now a little over three years old. In the Nanjing dialect, “Debbie” sounds hilariously close to “idiot,” and honestly sometimes I feel like he lives up to the name… not the brightest cat in the world.

After such a long time away from the sea, to suddenly have that damp, salty wind filling my lungs again — it really brought tears to my eyes for a moment. Sometimes the body remembers before the mind does.\n\nYour coffee allergy sounds terrifying, though. I’ve honestly never heard of something like that before. Such a shame you can’t drink it — I’ve always felt that coffee, like alcohol, adds an extra layer to the experience of life. A small ritual, a little spark, something that turns an ordinary moment into one worth remembering. But hey, maybe that’s just the addict in me speaking.\n\nAs for me, my boyfriend is still more than a thousand kilometers away, busy with his family business. For now, it’s just me, a roommate and Debbie at home, trying to quiet down and catch up on work. Maybe that’s not such a bad rhythm to settle into for a while.\n\nTalk soon,\nD",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nI could almost feel the air shift as I read your words — that particular quiet that comes only when you’re home again after a long journey, when the suitcase sits unopened in the corner, and the road still hums faintly in your bones. I’m relieved you made it back safely, though it sounds like the miles left their weight on you. Having Debbie there must have been a small but solid comfort, like a light left on in the window for your return(and who's Debbie, btw, I don't believe you mentioned her in your previous letters, but I would like to know about her)\n\nYour account of the coast in Typhoon Podul’s grip paints such a vivid scene. Not the gentle, cinematic beauty of a sunny postcard, but something far more primal. I can picture the sky pressed low and gray, the sea restless and alive, the wind carrying the salt straight into your skin. There’s a rare truth in moments like that — when nature refuses to be ornamental and instead shows you its raw pulse. I can imagine you standing there, the storm in your hair, feeling both small and entirely awake. Those are the kinds of memories that etch themselves into you, the ones that outlast the pretty, easy ones.\n\nThe story of the hillside heart made me smile, though I can see why the climb would be too much for someone with a fear of heights. There’s tenderness in the fact that you wanted to share that piece of your family’s history with him — and that you hold it so closely that it’s been shown to many friends over the years. It feels like one of those strange, beautiful markers we all have tucked away, something we carry forward simply because it has always been there, a quiet testament to love in another time.\n\nI can sense the shift in how you speak about him now — not as a perfect mirror to your pace, but as someone whose steps fall differently, yet still in your direction. That takes a certain grace to see and accept. The way you notice his gestures — the meals, the care for your home, the small act of making you a nightcap — says as much about you as it does about him. Sometimes love isn’t the grand stride side by side, but the quiet decision to keep orbiting one another, even if you spin at different speeds.\n\nYour caffeine revelation made me laugh in that soft, familiar way — the kind where you’re fondly amused by someone’s quirks, even as they’re admitting them. All this time, imagining yourself as a creature of the late hours, only to find the true culprit was a stubborn coffee habit. I hope that means your nights will soon settle into a gentler rhythm, one that lets you drift without restlessness, heres a fact about me im actually allergy towards coffee not caffine but coffee only one spoon could give me a panic attack i once had when i was 16 and had strong panic attack in the middle of the night i tried it one more time last year but had the same reaction it was only half a spoon so yeah i cant drink coffee even if i wanted to hahaha.\n\nI’m eager to see those coastal photos when they find their way to me. For now, I’ll hold the picture your words gave me — a horizon blurred by rain, waves folding over your legs, the air thick with salt and storm-light. That image will keep until the real thing arrives.\n\nTake the time you need to let yourself settle, to let the sea fade slowly from your skin. Some journeys follow you home for a while before they loosen their grip — and sometimes, you’re better for letting them.\n\nYour friend,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n读你的信时，我几乎能感受到空气的微妙变化——那是一种只有在长途旅行后回到家才会有的宁静，行李箱静静地放在角落未被打开，而旅途的余音仍在骨子里轻轻回响。得知你安全归来，我感到很欣慰，尽管听起来旅途的疲惫仍留在你身上。黛比在你身边一定给了你小小的但坚实的安慰，就像窗户里留着一盏灯等你归来（对了，黛比是谁？你之前信里没提到过她，但我很想知道她的事）。\n\n你描述的台风“波杜”肆虐下的海岸线，勾勒出一幅生动的画面。那不是阳光明媚的明信片上的温柔美景，而是一种更为原始的景象。我能想象天空低沉灰暗，大海波涛汹涌，海风将盐粒直接吹进你的皮肤。在这样的时刻，有一种罕见的真实——当自然拒绝成为装饰，而是向你展示它原始的脉动。我能想象你站在那里，风暴在你的发间，既感到渺小又完全清醒。这些记忆会深深地刻在你的心里，比那些美丽而轻松的记忆更加持久。\n\n你提到的山坡上的心形图案让我微笑，尽管我能理解对于有恐高症的人来说，攀登会是一种负担。你想要与他分享这段家族历史，这本身就是一种温柔——而你如此珍视它，多年来已向许多朋友展示过。这似乎是我们每个人心中都藏着的那种奇特而美丽的标志，我们带着它前行，仅仅因为它一直存在，是对另一个时代爱情的无声见证。\n\n我能感受到你现在谈论他的方式有所变化——不再是他完美地与你同步，而是他的步伐虽然不同，却依然朝向你。这需要一种特定的优雅才能看到并接受。你注意到他的举动——做饭、照顾家、为你调制夜酒——这些都同样反映了你和他。有时候，爱情不是并肩大步前行，而是默默决定继续围绕彼此旋转，即使旋转的速度不同。\n\n你提到的咖啡因发现让我会心一笑——那种温柔而熟悉的笑声，对某人的小癖好感到亲切的 amusement，即使他们在承认这些癖好时也是如此。这么长时间以来，你一直以为自己是夜猫子，结果却发现真正的罪魁祸首是顽固的咖啡习惯。希望这意味着你的夜晚将逐渐变得柔和，不再因不安而难以入眠。顺便说一句，我其实对咖啡过敏，不是咖啡因，而是咖啡本身。哪怕一勺咖啡就能让我恐慌发作，16岁时我曾在半夜经历了一次强烈的恐慌发作。去年我尝试了一次，但结果还是同样的反应，那还只是一半勺。所以，即使我想喝咖啡，也是不可能的，哈哈。\n\n我迫不及待想看到你寄来的海岸照片。现在，我将保留你文字中的画面——被雨水模糊的地平线，海浪拍打着你的双腿，空气中弥漫着盐和风暴的光芒。这幅画面将一直保留，直到真正的照片到来。\n\n花些时间让自己慢慢安定下来，让大海的痕迹从你的皮肤上慢慢消退。有些旅程会在你回家后继续跟随你一段时间，然后才会慢慢松开它的束缚——而有时候，让它们留下一段时间，你会变得更好。\n\n你的朋友，\n莫妮",

    "content": "Hi Lamine,\n\nI’m finally back home — tired, but with pieces of the journey still clinging to me. The trip didn’t turn out the way I had imagined, yet it still left me with moments I’ll remember. I’ve attached a few photos for you. To be honest, I’m not fully satisfied with them; I feel like my sense of composition and color grading has gotten worse compared to before. But still, they’re fragments of the places I passed through, so maybe they’ll speak for themselves.\n\nThe coast was nothing like the postcard I had in mind. A typhoon swept through, drenching the island and turning the sea into a restless gray. It wasn’t sunshine and turquoise water, but standing there in the storm had its own kind of beauty — raw and untamed, the kind that forces you to just breathe it in.\n\nYou’re right about what you said on children. There are far too many parents in the world who act irresponsibly, bringing kids into life without the ability to care for them. That’s a tragedy. For now, I’ll just stick to being Debbie’s “dad.” As for the idea of carving a giant heart — I don’t think I’m very good with my hands, so it might not be realistic for me, haha. But maybe I’ll find other ways of being romantic.\n\nI’m glad to hear you’ve finished your studies and are now looking for work. Do you already have a direction in mind — a field or type of job you’d like to pursue? Getting a driver’s license sounds like a good step forward too; it’s one of those things that quietly opens up more freedom.\n\nAnd yes, I’d really love to hear Bambara in your voice, if you feel comfortable sending it. A language always carries a music that can’t be captured by text alone.\n\nFor now, I’ll keep the stormy sea in my memory — not what I expected, but maybe more lasting in its own way. Looking forward to your next letter, and maybe some of your photos too.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nDomino",

And now I’m alone here for a while — my boyfriend is still up north with his parents. Thankfully, Debbie was waiting at home, so at least I’m not returning to an empty apartment.\n\nThe trip itself didn’t go as planned. Halfway through, my boyfriend had to return to his hometown, which left me to finish the journey on my own(family business). And just as if fate was playing with me, I arrived at the coast right when Typhoon Podul passed over the area.\nHeavy rain poured through the night and into the next day, swallowing the whole island on the weather radar. It wasn’t what I had imagined, but maybe that’s the beauty of it. I drove out to the shoreline and watched the sea in the storm, gray and violent. Later, when the rain finally eased, I walked down to the beach and let the waves hit my legs. It wasn’t cinematic sunlight and blue skies, but it was raw and real. And sometimes that’s enough.\n\nThis was also the first time I brought my bf to my hometown. I even wanted to show him a giant heart my dad once carved into a hillside when he was dating my mom. But the path was too steep, and he’s afraid of heights, so I had to leave him at the foot of the hill — it's a strange little family landmark that I showed to lots of my friends.\nIn the end, the trip wasn’t perfect. But I stood there, I breathed it in, and I came back with pieces of the sea still clinging to me.\nBy the way, I’ve already applied on the app to send photos — so in my next letter, I’ll share a few shots from the coast with you.\n\nAnd about my boyfriend as you mentioned… once I used to imagine him as a life partner in the full sense — someone who’d walk in rhythm with me step by step. But I’ve realized it’s not easy for him to move that way. If I push, it only creates more friction. So lately I’ve been thinking maybe I should go easier on him. He might not always keep pace with me, but he does love me in his own way — cooking, taking care of things at home, even making me a little nightcap when I’m stressed. That’s worth holding on to.\n\nAs for my late nights — I think I found the culprit. Lately I’ve become unusually sensitive to caffeine. If I drink anything after noon, my whole night is ruined with restlessness. Which means it’s not that I “belong to the night”… it’s just bad timing with my coffee cup. Typical me.\n\nFor now, I’m glad to be home, even if I’m still recovering from the miles. By the time you read this, I’ll be remembering the stormy sea rather than the sunlight I thought I’d find — and maybe that’s the kind of memory that lasts longer anyway.\n\nTalk soon,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n我终于回到家了，累得筋疲力尽。\n这次旅行比我预想的要辛苦得多。现在我一个人待在这里——我的男朋友还在北方陪他的父母。幸好黛比在家等我，所以至少我不是回到一个空荡荡的公寓。\n\n旅途本身并没有按计划进行。中途，我的男朋友不得不返回他的家乡（有家里的事），这让我不得不独自完成剩下的旅程。而仿佛命运在和我开玩笑，我到达海岸时，正好赶上台风“波杜尔”经过这片区域。\n大雨倾盆而下，持续了一整夜，直到第二天，整个岛屿在天气雷达上都变得模糊不清。这并不是我想象中的景象，但也许这就是它的魅力所在。我开车前往海边，看着暴风雨中的大海，灰暗而狂野。后来，当雨势终于减弱时，我走下海滩，让海浪拍打着我的双腿。虽然没有电影中的阳光和蓝天，但这一切都是原始而真实的。有时候，这就足够了。\n\n这也是我第一次带男朋友回我的家乡。我还想带他去看我爸爸在追求我妈妈时，在山坡上刻的一个巨大的心形图案。但山路太陡，他有恐高症，所以我只能让他留在山脚下——这是一个奇怪的小家庭地标，我曾向很多朋友展示过。\n最终，这次旅行并不完美。但我站在那里，深深地呼吸着，带着大海的痕迹回来了。\n顺便说一句，我已经在应用上申请发送照片——所以在我下一封信中，我会和你分享几张海岸的照片。\n\n至于你提到的我的男朋友……曾经，我想象他是我生命中的伴侣，一个能与我步伐一致的人。但后来我意识到，对他来说，这并不容易。如果我逼得太紧，只会增加更多的摩擦。所以最近我在想，也许我应该对他宽容一些。他可能不会总是跟上我的步伐，但他确实以他自己的方式爱着我——做饭、照顾家里的事情，甚至在我压力大时为我调一杯夜酒。这些都值得珍惜。\n\n至于我最近的熬夜问题——我想我找到了罪魁祸首。最近我对咖啡因变得异常敏感。如果下午之后喝任何含咖啡因的饮料，我的整个夜晚都会因不安而毁掉。所以，这并不是说我“属于夜晚”……只是咖啡杯的时间选择不当。典型的我。\n\n现在，我很高兴能回家，即使我还在从长途跋涉中恢复。等你读到这封信时，我会记得那暴风雨中的大海，而不是我原本期待的阳光——也许这正是那种更持久的记忆。\n\n改天聊，\n多米诺",

Tomorrow I’ll go to the coast and stay there for three days and two nights, then probably head home on Friday. So I might only reply to your next letter once I’m back.\n\n…Unfortunately, I just got some bad news while writing this — my boyfriend has to urgently fly to his parents’ city, which means he’ll miss the most important two days of this trip. Looks like I’ll be visiting the sea alone this time.\n\nAbout your question on kids — I’ve always thought that whether or not to raise a child depends less on desire and more on ability. Even if I were straight, with my current situation, I don’t think I’d choose to have one. That said, earlier this year during Lunar New Year, my dad carefully asked me if I’d ever consider adopting a child someday. I don’t have a fixed answer. Maybe in 10 or 20 years, I’ll feel differently about it. Who knows?\n\nI also looked up Bambara — there’s so little information about it on Wikipedia! The alphabet looks really unique. I think it’s fascinating.\n\nAnd I’m really sorry to hear that you feel you don’t belong in your neighborhood. That must be a heavy kind of pressure to live with. Are you still studying, or already working? Do you have any plans for the future?\n\nTake care, and I’ll send you more photos once I’m back from the sea.\nÀ bientôt,\nDomino 🌊",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine，\n\n我到了！\n昨晚我到达了此行的第二站——我男朋友的家乡。我会在这里待两天，然后前往海边，所以暂时没有海洋的照片。不过，我给你发几张沿途经过的山脉照片。\n\n说到开车……嗯，过去的两天里，我总共开了大约14个小时的车。我的车在高速公路上可以使用自适应巡航控制和车道保持功能，所以并不太累（好吧……可能还是有点累😅）。好消息是，接下来的两天不会再有长途驾驶了。明天我会去海边，待三天两晚，然后可能周五回家。所以，我可能要等回来后再回复你的下一封信。\n\n……不幸的是，我刚在写这封信时收到了一个坏消息——我男朋友必须紧急飞往他父母所在的城市，这意味着他将错过这次旅行最重要的两天。看来这次我要独自去海边了。\n\n关于你问的孩子问题——我一直认为，是否养育孩子更多取决于能力而不是欲望。即使我是异性恋，以我目前的情况，我也不认为会选择要一个孩子。不过，今年春节期间，我爸爸小心翼翼地问我是否考虑过将来领养一个孩子。我没有固定的答案。也许10年或20年后，我会有不同的想法。谁知道呢？\n\n我还查了一下班巴拉语——维基百科上的信息太少了！字母表看起来真的很独特。我觉得很有趣。\n\n听到你觉得自己在社区里格格不入，我感到非常遗憾。那一定是一种沉重的压力。你现在还在学习吗，还是已经在工作了？你对未来有什么计划吗？\n\n保重，等我从海边回来再给你发更多照片。\n希望很快能再联系，\nDomino 🌊",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nYou’ve nailed what makes Kiki’s Delivery Service timeless — it’s so deliberate, but somehow never sterile. For me, the heart of it isn’t just the cozy atmosphere, but the way Kiki’s struggles mirror early adulthood. She starts with talent, drive, and optimism, then hits that wall where nothing feels right — she even loses her “magic” for a while. That’s the part I think most people forget: freedom and skill don’t exempt you from burnout. They just give you new ways to recover. That’s why the quiet moments — baking bread, sitting by the ocean — hit harder than the flying scenes for me.\n\nYour thoughts about the town being Italian are interesting. I’ve read it was inspired by a blend of places — Sweden, Italy, and a few coastal French towns — which explains why it feels familiar but hard to pin down. That “I’ve been here before” sensation is part of what makes the setting feel alive.\n\nAbout your boyfriend, you said you end up protecting him. That’s admirable, but have you thought about whether it’s sustainable? Protection works both ways; if one person always carries it, the weight starts to grind them down. You’re not scheming or manipulative, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t expect self-preservation from him, too. Otherwise, it’s not a partnership, it’s guardianship.\n\nThe nocturnal schedule… so you’ve joined the vampire guild. I get it — late nights can feel almost sacred. But I’m curious, is it just comfort, or are you avoiding something in the daytime? The answer might tell you more than the hours ever could.\n\nThis road trip — I want details when you get back, but not just “we went here, we saw this.” Tell me the soundtrack you played when the road stretched empty. The smell when you first rolled down the window after hours of AC air. The sound the tires made when the pavement changed. Those are the things you’ll remember years from now.\n\nDon’t write back until you’ve finished the trip. Let it all sink in first, then give me the whole thing in one hit.\n\nLooking forward to your next one,\n– Moni\n\nP.S. If you pass through any tiny towns, check the thrift stores. The weirder the better.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n你精准地捕捉到了《魔女宅急便》之所以成为经典的原因——它非常用心，但又从不显得刻板。对我来说，这部作品的魅力不仅在于温馨的氛围，还在于琪琪的挣扎与初入成年的体验如此相似。她带着才华、动力和乐观开始，但很快遇到了瓶颈，一切都不再顺心如意——她甚至一度失去了自己的“魔法”。我想，这是很多人容易忽略的部分：自由和技能并不能让你免于疲惫。它们只是给了你新的方式去恢复。这也是为什么那些安静的时刻——比如烤面包、坐在海边——对我来说比飞行的场景更加触动人心。\n\n你提到小镇有意大利风情，这很有趣。我读过，这个小镇的灵感来源于多个地方——瑞典、意大利和一些法国沿海小镇——这解释了为什么它既熟悉又难以具体定位。那种“我曾来过这里”的感觉，正是让这个场景显得生动的原因之一。\n\n关于你的男朋友，你说你总是保护他。这很值得尊敬，但你有没有想过这是否可持续？保护是双向的；如果总是由一个人承担，这份重担最终会压垮他。你并不是在算计或操纵，但这并不意味着你不应该期望他也有自我保护的能力。否则，这就不算是一段伙伴关系，而是一种监护关系。\n\n至于夜猫子的生活方式……看来你已经加入了吸血鬼公会。我理解——深夜确实有一种近乎神圣的感觉。但我很好奇，这仅仅是因为舒适，还是你在逃避白天的某些事情？答案可能会比时间本身告诉你更多。\n\n这次公路旅行——等你回来后，我希望你能分享更多细节，而不仅仅是“我们去了这里，看到了那个”。告诉我，当道路延伸无尽时，你们播放的音乐是什么。当空调空气在车内循环了几个小时后，你第一次摇下车窗时闻到的气味是什么。当路面变换时，轮胎发出的声音是什么。这些是你多年后仍然会记得的事情。\n\n等你旅行结束后再给我回信吧。先让一切沉淀下来，然后一次性告诉我全部。\n\n期待你的下一封信，\n——莫妮\n\nP.S. 如果你经过一些小镇，记得去逛逛二手店。越奇怪的越好。",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nSo — I watched Kiki’s Delivery Service.\nAnd wow… Miyazaki really has a gift for weaving together beautiful little details into something timeless. There’s a kind of beauty in this film that feels removed from time — so much so that I never felt like I was watching something made decades ago.\nStory-wise, it’s designed to be “mistake-proof” — in a way that’s almost textbook. I could see the intention behind each choice, each little beat. But maybe that’s exactly why it’s a classic — because it’s so deliberate without losing warmth.\nThe art direction, though… I loved it. Considering the era, it’s incredible how they kept enough frames for smooth motion while still making each shot aesthetically rich.\nThat little coastal town — was it based on somewhere in Italy? The atmosphere felt so vivid, like I’d seen it in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind. The same kind of sunlit streets, sea breeze, and lived-in charm.\n\nWhat you wrote about my boyfriend — I think you summed him up perfectly. And about growing up in a kind environment… hmm. I’m not sure if it’s purely a good thing or not. I’m not exactly a scheming, manipulative person myself, but I do believe self-protection is important. That’s something I don’t really see in him… which I guess means I end up being the one to protect him. (Sigh.)\n\nI’m glad you’ve fixed your sleep schedule — unfortunately, I’m the opposite right now. My body clock has been slipping into a nocturnal rhythm lately. I know it’s not great, but between the late-night restlessness and the morning struggle to get out of bed, I haven’t found a fix.\nThat said, tomorrow I’m waking up early for my southbound road trip — maybe this journey will be the reset I need. By the time you read this, I should be about 600 kilometers away from home.\n\nTalk soon — hopefully with stories from the road.\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n所以——我看了《魔女宅急便》。\n哇……宫崎骏真的有将美丽的小细节编织成永恒之作的天赋。这部电影中有一种超脱时间的美——以至于我从未感到自己在观看几十年前的作品。\n从故事角度来看，它设计得“无懈可击”——几乎可以说是教科书式的。我能感受到每个选择、每个小节背后的意图。但也许这正是它成为经典的原因——因为它既刻意又不失温暖。\n至于美术指导……我非常喜欢。考虑到那个时代，他们能够在保持流畅动作的同时，使每个镜头都充满美感，这真是令人难以置信。\n那个沿海小镇——是不是以意大利的某个地方为原型？氛围如此生动，让我想起了《乔乔的奇妙冒险：黄金之风》。同样的阳光街道、海风和充满生活气息的魅力。\n\n你对我男朋友的描述——我觉得你总结得非常到位。至于在一个温和的环境中长大……嗯。我不确定这是否完全是件好事。我自己并不是一个善于算计、操纵他人的人，但我确实认为自我保护很重要。这正是我在他身上看不到的东西……也许这意味着我需要成为保护他的人。（叹气。）\n\n很高兴你调整好了作息时间——不幸的是，我却相反。最近我的生物钟逐渐变成了夜猫子模式。我知道这不太好，但在夜深人静时的不安和早晨挣扎着起床之间，我还没有找到解决办法。\n话说回来，明天我要早起开始南下的公路旅行——也许这次旅程会是我需要的重启。等你看到这封信时，我应该已经离家600公里了。\n\n希望很快能和你分享旅途中的故事。\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hi Lamine 🐾\n\nThank you for liking my photos! Actually, my boyfriend and I haven’t gone on a real trip yet — the last pictures I sent you were taken right here in my city, just a small weekend outing, not exactly “travel.” But the day after tomorrow… we’re finally going on a proper long trip!\n\nIt’s been such a long time since I’ve seen real blue skies, white clouds, and clear ocean water. The closest sea to my city (Nanjing) is at the mouth of the Yangtze River, which means the river carries all its mud and silt downstream, turning the nearby sea a muddy yellow (you can even see it on Google Earth!). So, for the past few days, I’ve been planning this trip — driving with my boyfriend all the way to the southern coast of China, not too far from the side facing Taiwan. The water there is supposed to be beautiful. The only problem is… the weather forecast for the next few weeks is not great. I’ve been debating whether I should really drive ten hours just to stand by a dark, cloudy ocean for one afternoon. But in the end, I decided to go anyway. Tomorrow I’ll pack my bags, fill up the car, and get ready to leave!\n\nAnd thank you for your kind wishes about our wedding. I can tell you with absolute certainty — love between men does exist. Sex and love are not the same thing. I’ve met many people, had a few relationships, and eventually found stability with my current partner. I believe choosing your other half is a process of filtering and learning. So please, little brother, don’t let one man’s bitter comment kill your desire for love.\n\nAbout Mali… I just looked at some news. Is your country going through a difficult situation right now? I saw that the Chinese embassy even issued an evacuation notice. I don’t know the exact details, but I hope everything is okay on your side. As for what you said about “not being able to leave” — well, I think in life we all have to find the way of living that makes us feel safest and most comfortable. If staying in your own neighborhood gives you that sense of security, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. (sending you another big hug 🤗)\n\nAnd your cat… oh my god, so cute! I can totally imagine them climbing onto your chest when you’re sleeping and purring for head pats. My own cat… well, he’s not really the cuddly type. Most of the time he refuses to “stick” with me. Whenever I pet him, I get the “ugh, stop it” face. (wipes tears)\n\nI’ve also attached a few photos of my cat, Debbie. He’s really not very photogenic — always looking a bit silly in pictures. There’s also a hand-drawn sketch my friend made of my fursona holding Debbie and saying, “You understand Mandarin???” because sometimes he really does respond to everything I say, as if he gets every word. Hahaha.\n\nTake care, and I’ll send you some photos from my trip soon!\nÀ bientôt,\nDomino 🌿",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine 🐾\n\n谢谢你喜欢我的照片！其实，我和男朋友还没有真正去旅行过——上次发给你的照片都是在这座城市里拍的，只是一个小周末的短途出行，算不上“旅行”。但是后天……我们终于要开始一次真正的长途旅行了！\n\n我已经很久没有见过真正的蓝天、白云和清澈的海水了。我所在的城市（南京）最近的海在长江入海口，由于长江携带了大量的泥沙，使得附近的海水呈黄褐色（你甚至可以在谷歌地球上看到！）。所以，这几天我一直在计划这次旅行——和男朋友开车一路前往中国南部的海岸，离台湾那边不远。那里的海水据说非常美丽。唯一的问题是……接下来几周的天气预报不太好。我一直在犹豫是否真的要开车十个小时，只为在一个阴沉多云的海边待一个下午。但最终，我还是决定出发。明天我就要收拾行李，给车加满油，准备出发了！\n\n感谢你对我们婚礼的美好祝福。我可以非常肯定地告诉你——男人之间的爱情是存在的。性和爱并不是一回事。我见过很多人，谈过几次恋爱，最终和现在的伴侣稳定下来。我认为选择另一半是一个筛选和学习的过程。所以，亲爱的弟弟，请不要让一个男人的刻薄评论扼杀你对爱情的渴望。\n\n关于马里……我刚刚看了些新闻。你的国家现在是不是正经历着一些困难？我看到中国大使馆甚至发布了撤离通知。虽然我不了解具体的情况，但我希望你那边一切安好。至于你说的“无法离开”——嗯，我认为在生活中，我们每个人都要找到让自己感到最安全、最舒适的生活方式。如果留在自己的社区能给你这种安全感，那也未必是坏事。（给你一个大大的拥抱 🤗）\n\n还有你的猫咪……天啊，太可爱了！我完全可以想象它们在你睡觉时爬到你胸口，求摸头的样子。我的猫咪……嗯，他可不是那种喜欢黏人的类型。大多数时候他都不愿意“黏”着我。每次我摸他，他都会露出“哎呀，别这样”的表情。（擦眼泪）\n\n我还附上了几张我的猫咪Debbie的照片。他真的不太上镜——照片里总是显得有点傻傻的。还有一张是我朋友画的我的毛茸茸形象抱着Debbie，说“你懂中文吗？？”因为有时候他真的会回应我说的每一句话，好像什么都懂。哈哈哈。\n\n保重，等我旅行回来会给你发一些照片！\n不久见，\nDomino 🌿",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nAlright — the clock is ticking.\nKiki’s Delivery Service, candle lit, drink poured… I’m expecting a full report next time. And don’t you dare try to slip past me with a one-sentence “it was nice.” I want your entire worldview rearranged on paper.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like the kind of person who turns “domestic” into something quietly cinematic. Nightcaps after burnout? That’s dangerously close to a movie scene. And while you call him “slightly over-spoiled,” I think that’s just shorthand for “raised in an environment where kindness is instinct, not performance.” I’d argue that’s a rarer upbringing than people admit.\n\nYour name story was a trip — Huang, Kevin, Domino. It’s like each one is a lens on a slightly different life, and you pick the one that fits the day. Domino feels like it carries a little mystery. Kevin feels like the easygoing friend. Huang feels like the last name that would appear in a book’s acknowledgements. I can see why you gravitate to Domino when you want distance from the noise.\n\nYou guessed my dad’s in business — you’re right. And I think you hit the nail on temperament. He’s a “wide net” type, I’m a “quiet harpoon” type. We move differently, but maybe we’re fishing in the same ocean.\n\nYour take on anchors hit me harder than I expected. Maybe “finding the place” and “becoming the version of yourself who’s ready to stay” aren’t separate — maybe they happen at the same time, like recognizing a face in the crowd only when you’re in the right mood to look up.\n\nI’ve been working remotely since I left my last job, which means I haven’t “bumped into” anyone in ages. My sleeping schedule’s finally repairing itself, and funny enough, that small fix made the rest of my days flow better. Apparently one well-timed sunrise can fix more than coffee ever could.\n\nAlso — I’m glad you’re taking that coastal road trip. Forget perfect skies; a little wind is what makes a trip stick in your memory. Just… please send a sentence or two from the road. I don’t care if it’s about the sea or the pasta.\n\nUntil your Kiki review,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Domino，\n\n好吧——时间在滴答作响。\n《魔女宅急便》、蜡烛点燃、饮料斟满……下次我可要一份完整的报告。别想用一句“还不错”就蒙混过关。我要的是你整个世界观的重新排列。\n\n你的男朋友听起来像是能把“居家”变成某种静谧电影的人。工作疲惫后的夜宵？这简直接近电影中的场景了。虽然你称他为“有点被宠坏”，但我认为这只是“在一个善良是本能而非表演的环境中长大”的委婉说法。我认为这种成长环境比人们承认的要稀有得多。\n\n你的名字故事真有趣——黄、Kevin、Domino。就像每个名字都是对稍微不同生活的镜头，你选择适合当天的那个。Domino似乎带有一点神秘感。Kevin像是那个随和的朋友。黄像是会在书的致谢部分出现的姓氏。我明白为什么当你想远离喧嚣时，会选择Domino。\n\n你猜对了我爸爸在做生意——你是对的。而且我觉得你对性格的描述也很到位。他是一个“撒大网”的人，而我是一个“安静的鱼叉”人。我们的行动方式不同，但也许我们在同一个海洋里捕鱼。\n\n你对“锚”的看法比我预期的更打动我。也许“找到那个地方”和“成为那个准备好停留的自己”并不是分开的——也许它们同时发生，就像只有在你心情正好抬头时，才能在人群中认出一张脸。\n\n自从我离开上一份工作后，我一直远程工作，这意味着我已经很久没有“偶遇”任何人了。我的睡眠时间表终于开始恢复，有趣的是，这个小小的改变让我的其他日子也变得更好了。显然，一个恰到好处的日出比咖啡能解决更多问题。\n\n另外——我很高兴你正在沿着海岸线旅行。别管什么晴空万里；一点风才是让旅行留在记忆中的关键。只是……请从路上发一两句话给我。我不在乎是关于大海还是意大利面。\n\n等你的《魔女宅急便》评论，\nMoni",

It comforts me to see a happy gay couple like yours. My first and last booty call was with a 30-year-old man, after we'd finished having sex. He said to me, \"Lamine, love between two men doesn't exist.\"\n\nI think you have the solution! A van as a mobile café, you can start with that. If it's successful right now, try opening a coffee shop.\n\nReally, Domino, I don't think I'm going to be able to leave Mali, even if I'm not the happiest person here, but I'm a bit scared of moving to a foreign country where I don't know anyone and have to start all over again.\n\nOh thank you so much for your kind words...🥹\n\nAs I said earlier in the letter, the photos are really nice, you've got an eye for taking photos it seems.....( Wait, that's normal given the work you do.).\nSo now I feel obliged to send you a little something in return...

He takes care of meals, chores, mixes me a little nightcap when I’m burned out… He’s warm, thoughtful, and honestly, I couldn’t ask for more.\n\nAbout my name —\nDomino is the ID I use across most online spaces. Since I’m in China, my legal name is of course Chinese. My family name is Huang, which I sometimes use in formal or client settings.\nWhen I was eleven, I gave myself the English name Kevin, and it stuck — friends from Thailand, Italy, and elsewhere all know me that way.\nBut between you and me, I think I prefer Domino.\nIt feels like a softer, slightly more comfortable version of myself. Not fake — just… a little more distant from the noise of real life.\n\nOn what you said about your dad —\nI had a bit of a reckless guess: is he in business? That kind of “wide circle” approach feels like something that fits naturally in that world — cast a net, make connections, leave doors open.\nBut honestly, I don’t think “many friends” and “deep friends” are opposites. They’re just different stages of the same path: meet, observe, choose.\nI doubt your dad is friends with literally everyone, and I doubt you’d ever find your kindred spirits without meeting some new people first.\nSo maybe it’s not really a difference in values — maybe it’s just temperament. Two different ways of moving through the same social map.\n\nWhat you said about anchors…\nYeah. Maybe thirty years from now, I’ll pick a country, a city, a view — and finally stay put. But right now, I haven’t found the place yet.\nAnd more importantly, I haven’t yet become the version of me who’s ready to stay.\n\nSpeaking of moving — I finalized my coastal road trip! We’re heading off this Saturday, fingers crossed for decent weather. I’m hoping for something cinematic: not perfect skies, but something with a little wind and drama.\n(Also — pasta seems to appear at home today, though I’m pretty sure it is not going to come with white sauce. Still, a sign of progress.)\n\nYour question about “settling with someone” really made me pause.\nI think… for now, the answer is no.\nA year and a half ago, I left this city to move up north and live with my boyfriend. We stayed there for a year, but eventually I realized the place wasn’t right for either of us.\nSo I brought him back down with me. It cost time, energy, money — but I don’t regret a single part of it.\nTo me, if someone really shares your rhythm, they won’t resist the road.\nI don’t want a love that keeps me in place. I want a love that moves with me.\n\nTalk to you again soon — and that time, with my Kiki’s Delivery Service review.\n\nYour not-so-anchored friend,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n好吧好吧——这可是正式的。\n我今天要观看《魔女宅急便》。\n不再拖延，不再找哲学借口。我会点上一根蜡烛，倒一杯酒，让吉卜力工作室静静地重塑我的世界观。\n如果下次写信时我没有提到这件事，你有完全的权限来“吓唬”我。\n\n现在——关于我的男朋友。\n他比我大一岁，高高瘦瘦，散发着一种“大学男生”的气息——不仅仅是外表，还包括他的言谈举止和思维方式。\n有时候我觉得他情感上还很年轻，这在最好的和最奇怪的意义上。可能是因为他成长在一个非常有爱的家庭——爱到他被（稍微）宠坏了。不过，我可不会抱怨。\n他对我非常好。他负责做饭、家务，当我疲惫不堪时，还会为我调一杯小酒……他温暖、体贴，老实说，我不能再要求更多了。\n\n关于我的名字——\nDomino 是我在大多数网络空间使用的ID。因为我在中国，我的法定名字当然是中文的。我的姓是黄，有时候在正式或客户场合我会用这个名字。\n十一岁时，我给自己取了英文名Kevin，这个名字一直沿用至今——泰国、意大利等地的朋友都这样叫我。\n但你我之间说，我更喜欢Domino。\n这感觉像是一个更柔和、更舒适的自己。不是假的——只是……离现实生活中的喧嚣稍微远一点。\n\n关于你说的你爸爸——\n我有一个大胆的猜测：他是不是在做生意？那种“广交朋友”的方式在商界似乎很自然——撒网、建立联系、留下机会。\n但老实说，我认为“朋友多”和“朋友深”并不是对立的。它们只是同一条路上的不同阶段：遇见、观察、选择。\n我怀疑你爸爸不可能和每个人都是朋友，我也怀疑你如果不先认识一些新朋友，怎么能找到你的知音。\n所以，这可能不是价值观的差异——可能是性格的不同。在同一个社交地图上，两种不同的走法。\n\n你说的关于“锚点”……\n是的。也许三十年后，我会选择一个国家、一个城市、一个风景——然后终于安定下来。但目前，我还没有找到那个地方。\n更重要的是，我还没有成为那个准备好安定下来的自己。\n\n说到搬家——我已经确定了沿海公路旅行！我们这周六出发，希望天气不错。我希望旅途能有电影般的感觉：不是完美的天空，而是有一点风和戏剧性。\n（另外——今天家里似乎出现了意大利面，虽然我确定不会是白酱的。但无论如何，这都是一个进步的迹象。）\n\n你关于“与某人安定下来”的问题真的让我停顿了一下。\n我想……现在答案是否定的。\n一年半前，我离开这座城市，搬到北方和男朋友一起生活。我们在那里待了一年，但最终我意识到那个地方对我们俩都不合适。\n所以我带他回到了这里。这花费了时间、精力和金钱——但我一点也不后悔。\n对我来说，如果一个人真的与你合拍，他不会抗拒旅途。\n我不想要一种让我停滞不前的爱。我想要一种能与我同行的爱。\n\n过几天再聊——到时候我会带上《魔女宅急便》的影评。\n\n你不安定的朋友，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Domino,\n\nYour line about “we all eventually become the thing we once hated” really stuck with me. I’ve thought about that more times than I’d like to admit. Seeing flashes of your dad in yourself — even in something as small as the “decision-maker” role — is painfully relatable. I sometimes catch myself doing little things that echo my father, even though we’ve always been so different.\n\nAnd about what you said — if life ever brings us to the same city and we sit down for a drink (alcoholic or not), that honestly feels like one of those rare offers that stick in my mind. Not because of the drink, but because it’s rare to hear someone say that and genuinely mean it. I admire that you’d want to carry this connection into the real world. Most people keep pen-pal exchanges in a little bubble, but the fact that you’re open to crossing that line makes this whole conversation feel a lot more real.\n\nAlso, you’ve mentioned your boyfriend a few times in your letters — he sounds like he adds a lot of warmth and balance to your plans. I’m curious, what’s he like? And one more thing I’ve been meaning to ask — you always sign your letters as Domino. Is that the name you go by everywhere, or more like a pen-pal name you use here? I just realized I don’t even know what you prefer to be called.\n\nYou already know my dad is an extrovert with a huge circle. I admire him for that, but I’ve always valued depth over breadth — fewer friends, but stronger bonds. We’ve clashed plenty over this. He thinks my quiet nature limits me, while I see it as a way to choose my connections with purpose. I guess in a way, we’re both “deciders,” just in different arenas. Maybe the challenge isn’t escaping our parents’ traits, but learning how to own them without letting them own us.\n\nAbout anchors — I feel the same way you do. Property, permanent roots, even the thought of staying in one place too long… it feels like a door closing. My Odyssey is the opposite of that — it’s a refusal to commit to one “harbor” too soon. But I think we both know that someday, there will be a place or a person that makes anchoring feel like the natural next step. Just… not now.\n\nAs for Kiki’s Delivery Service, it’s almost poetic how it ties into this. Kiki leaves home not to settle, but to grow. She faces creative burnout, doubts herself, and even loses her ability to fly at one point. But in the end, it’s not about finding a forever home — it’s about regaining her balance and keeping herself in motion. That’s why I think you’d appreciate it — it’s less about the magic and more about that quiet inner shift watch when you feel it's time.\n\nYour coastal dilemma made me laugh because I’d be exactly the person to drive 10 hours just to see gray waves. Maybe that’s part of the charm — not every trip gives you “crystal blue.” Sometimes you show up and the ocean is moody, and that becomes the memory you keep. (But if the pasta shows up first, I’ll consider that a fair trade) And here’s a wild fact: I haven’t seen the sea in years. Not the gray waves, not the crystal ones. That will finally change when I start university in Alexandria — my first time living right by the coast.\n\nBefore I go, I want to flip your own question back to you. If you don’t see yourself settling in one place for now, do you see yourself settling with someone? Or do you think that, like a city, people can’t hold you in place either?\n\nYour still-not-anchored friend,\nMoni\n\nP.S. I’m holding you accountable for watching Kiki’s Delivery Service. No excuses.",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的多米诺，\n\n你提到的“我们最终都会变成曾经讨厌的那个人”这句话让我印象深刻。我承认，我思考过这个问题很多次。看到你身上有你父亲的影子——即使是在“决策者”这样的小角色上——这种感觉让我感同身受。有时，我也会发现自己在做一些小事，这些小事让我想起了我的父亲，尽管我们一直都很不同。\n\n关于你说的——如果生活让我们来到同一个城市，我们可以坐下来喝一杯（无论是否含酒精），这确实是我脑海中难得的提议之一。这并不是因为那杯饮料，而是因为很少有人会这样说，并且是真心诚意的。我钦佩你愿意将这种联系带入现实世界。大多数人都会把笔友交流局限在一个小圈子里，但你愿意跨越这条界限，这让我们的对话显得更加真实。\n\n另外，你在信中提到过你的男朋友几次——他听起来像是为你的生活增添了温暖和平衡。我很好奇，他是什么样的人？还有一件事我一直想问——你总是以多米诺署名。这是你在所有地方都用的名字，还是只是在这里用的笔名？我突然意识到我甚至不知道你更喜欢被叫什么名字。\n\n你已经知道我父亲是个外向的人，有很多朋友。我钦佩他这一点，但我一直更看重深度而不是广度——朋友少一些，但关系更牢固。我们因此有过不少争执。他认为我内向的性格限制了我，而我则认为这是一种有目的的选择我的社交圈的方式。我想，从某种意义上说，我们都是“决策者”，只是在不同的领域。也许挑战不在于摆脱父母的特质，而在于学会拥有这些特质，而不被它们所束缚。\n\n关于“锚”——我也有同样的感觉。房产、永久的根，甚至只是待在一个地方太久……这些都像是关闭了一扇门。我的奥德赛之旅与之相反——它是一种拒绝过早地在一个“港湾”中停留的态度。但我想我们都知道，总有一天，会有一个地方或一个人，让扎根成为自然而然的下一步。只是……现在还不是时候。\n\n至于《魔女宅急便》，它与这一切的联系几乎是诗意的。琪琪离家不是为了定居，而是为了成长。她经历了创作的枯竭，怀疑自己，甚至一度失去了飞行的能力。但最终，这并不是关于找到一个永远的家——而是关于找回平衡，保持自己的动力。这就是为什么我觉得你会喜欢它——它更多地关注那种内心的微妙变化，当你觉得是时候的时候。\n\n你的海边困境让我笑了，因为我就是那种会驱车10小时去看灰色海浪的人。也许这就是魅力的一部分——不是每一次旅行都能给你“水晶蓝”。有时你到达那里，大海是阴郁的，而这成为你保留的记忆。（但如果先出现的是意面，我也会认为这是一个公平的交换）这里有一个疯狂的事实：我已经好几年没有见过大海了。无论是灰色的波浪，还是水晶般的海水。这将在我去亚历山大上大学时改变——这是我第一次住在海边。\n\n在结束之前，我想把你的问题反过来问你。如果你现在不打算在一个地方定居，那你是否打算和某个人安定下来？或者你认为，就像一个城市一样，人也无法让你停留？\n\n你尚未扎根的朋友，\n莫妮\n\nP.S. 我会监督你观看《魔女宅急便》。没有借口。",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nYour line about “belonging nowhere” hit something soft in me.\nMaybe it’s a shared trait among people who lean inward — introverts, wanderers, quiet thinkers. If life ever brings us to the same city, I’d love to sit down for a drink with you someday. Alcoholic or alcohol-free — your choice. The point is just to share space for a while, with no rush to explain everything.\n\nAbout my dad… oof, where do I even begin? I’m not sure how to describe it in English, but it’s something like Il peut être plus masculin que masculin.\nHe has this habit of framing himself as “the decider” in our family — and to be fair, by age and income, he does have the standing. But emotionally? It’s not always easy.\nJust recently, I had some problems with my business project, so I drafted two possible solutions — spent some time thinking and writing, maybe a few hundred words in total — and when I messaged him for advice, all he said was: “The second one.” That’s it.\nHonestly, I was hoping for more than that.\nThe hardest part is that now, as I’ve started living independently with my boyfriend and a roommate, I sometimes catch myself doing the same thing — putting myself in the “decision-maker” role without realizing it. Like it’s some generational curse hard-coded into my DNA.\nThere’s a saying that used to go around Chinese internet: “We all eventually become the thing we once hated.”\nGod, I hope not. But some days, I’m not so sure.\n\nI’ve definitely heard of Kiki’s Delivery Service, but I actually know nothing about the story. I’ve been a bit overwhelmed lately, but once things settle down, I promise I’ll watch it. If I forget to bring it up, please remind me. Hold me accountable, Moni!\n\nAnd yes — I love the sea. Especially when it’s blue.\nSadly, the nearest coastline from where I live is part of the Yangtze River estuary, which means all the seawater here turns muddy yellow from the silt and runoff. You can literally see it on Google Earth — it’s wild.\nLately, I’ve been planning a long road trip with my boyfriend — we’re thinking of heading down to the southern coast of China, near the area across from Taiwan. The sea there is supposed to be gorgeous, crystal blue… but the weather forecast has been gloomy for weeks. So now I’m torn: do I drive 10 hours chasing a dream born months ago, only to stand in front of dark gray waves under a cloudy sky?\n\nAs for your last question —\nI’ve actually thought about this a lot.\nSome older friends I once traveled with would sometimes say things like, “I could totally settle here, live a self-sufficient life, grow old in peace.” And I’d smile, but inside, I’d feel the opposite.\nThe more I see of the world — its textures, its moods, its mysteries — the more I feel like I can’t stay still for too long.\nIn China, people care a lot about buying property. It’s seen as a kind of anchor. My parents even offered to help with a down payment if I ever wanted to buy a house. But honestly? The idea of tying myself to one city right now feels… terrifying.\nMaybe in a few years, or decades, I’ll feel differently.\nJust like how my views on love have shifted over the years — every relationship seemed to reset something inside me, until I landed in this one. This one feels different. More settled. But still — I try not to predict too far ahead.\n\nPasta, by the way, hasn’t shown up on the table yet. But if my boyfriend starts casually buying mayonnaise, I’ll know something’s cooking. Literally.\n\nTalk to you soon,\nyour not-so-haunted friend,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n你提到的“无处归属”触动了我内心柔软的部分。\n也许这是内向者、流浪者、安静思考者之间的共同特质。如果有一天我们的生活轨迹交汇在同一个城市，我希望能和你坐下来喝一杯，无论酒精饮料还是无酒精饮料——由你选择。重点只是在一段时间里共享空间，不必急于解释一切。\n\n关于我爸爸……哎，从何说起呢？用英语很难描述，但大概就像“他可以比男性更男性”。\n他习惯于在我们家扮演“决策者”的角色——公平地说，从年龄和收入来看，他确实有这个地位。但在情感上呢？这并不总是那么容易。\n最近，我的商业项目遇到了一些问题，所以我起草了两个可能的解决方案——花了一些时间思考和写作，可能总共几百字——当我向他寻求建议时，他只说了一句：“第二个。”仅此而已。\n说实话，我本希望得到更多。\n最困难的部分是，现在我开始和男朋友及一个室友独立生活，有时会发现自己也在扮演“决策者”的角色，而自己却没有意识到。就像这是一种代代相传的诅咒，深深刻入了我的DNA。\n中国互联网上曾经流行一句话：“我们最终都会成为曾经厌恶的那个人。”\n上帝啊，我希望不是这样。但有些日子，我也不那么确定了。\n\n我确实听说过《魔女宅急便》，但对故事一无所知。最近我有点忙，但一旦事情安定下来，我保证会看。如果我忘了提起，莫妮，请提醒我。让我负起责任！\n\n是的——我喜欢大海。尤其是当它是蓝色的时候。\n遗憾的是，我住的地方最近的海岸线是长江入海口的一部分，这意味着这里的海水因泥沙和径流而变成了浑浊的黄色。你甚至可以在谷歌地球上看到——真是令人难以置信。\n最近，我计划和男朋友进行一次长途自驾游——我们打算前往中国南部沿海，靠近台湾对面的地区。据说那里的海水非常美丽，清澈湛蓝……但天气预报已经连续几周都是阴沉的。现在我陷入了两难：是否要驱车10小时追逐几个月前的梦想，最终却站在阴云密布的天空下的灰暗海浪前？\n\n至于你最后的问题——\n我确实思考过很多。\n一些我曾经一起旅行的老朋友有时会说：“我完全可以在这里定居，过上自给自足的生活，安度晚年。”我会微笑，但内心却感到相反。\n我看到的世界越多——它的质感、情绪、神秘——我越觉得不能在一个地方停留太久。\n在中国，人们非常重视买房。这被视为一种锚定。我的父母甚至提出，如果我想要买房，他们愿意帮助支付首付。但老实说？现在将自己绑定在一个城市的想法让我感到……恐惧。\n也许几年或几十年后，我会有不同的感受。\n就像我对爱情的看法随着时间的推移而改变——每一段关系似乎都会重置我内心的一些东西，直到我遇到了这一段。这一段感觉不同。更稳定。但即便如此——我尽量不预测太远的未来。\n\n顺便说一句，意大利面还没有出现在餐桌上。但如果我男朋友开始随意购买蛋黄酱，我就会知道有事情在酝酿。真的是这样。\n\n很快和你聊天，\n你不再那么困扰的朋友，\n多米诺",

Today my boyfriend and I went out together — we took a little trip to an island in the middle of the Yangtze River. I’m writing this from an outdoor-sports-themed café on the island, surrounded by camping seats and bicycles. Aside from the Milky Way photos, I’ll attach a snapshot from today too — just something simple from my phone, but it might give you a glimpse of my world.\n\nAnd yes, if the day ever comes when we get married, you’re absolutely invited! 😄 I do think I’ll be the one to propose — going abroad to legally register our marriage is part of the plan too. It feels nice that you find it romantic; honestly, I’ve never been much of a fairytale person, but this one… I’d like it to come true.\n\nI’m also glad you liked the café idea. I’ve been thinking — if a physical store is too risky, maybe we could try converting a van into a mobile coffee truck. One that pops up at furry conventions or local markets. Who knows? Sometimes weird ideas are the best ones.\n\nAs for your desire to leave Mali — I understand that’s a huge dream. But maybe, if you get the chance someday, you could start with something smaller, like a short trip abroad? Travel can be a way of softly trying out different versions of life. When I first visited Hong Kong in university, it made a deep impression on me — the mix of cultures, the infrastructure, the pace. Over time it felt less magical, sure, but that first experience helped me see there are so many ways to live. Maybe somewhere out there, a lifestyle exists that fits you better — and discovering it could be a goal worth chasing.\n\nAlso, please don’t worry about disappointing people in a relationship — at least not even a bit from me. I genuinely enjoy writing with you, and your letters never feel like a burden. Quite the opposite — they’re a breath of air. I think we all deserve friendships that ease pressure, not pile more on, right?\n\nI’ve sent over the Milky Way photos! (Though… confession: not all of them are technically Milky Way shots 😅). Some were taken in winter, in the dead of night, somewhere between two cities in northeastern China. I had to escape the city light pollution — which meant hours of driving through freezing, empty roads. But here’s the thing: in winter, the Milky Way isn’t visible in the northern hemisphere. So... let’s just say I added a little post-processing magic ✨. Hope you don’t mind. I still think they turned out kinda nice.\n\nTake care, and as always, no rush in replying. I’ll be here.\n\nÀ bientôt,\nDomino 🐾",
    "translatedContent": "嗨，Lamine 🌧️\n\n南京也在下雨——有一个台风从太平洋袭来，所以天空已经阴沉了好几天。不过幸运的是，这个周末雨停了！今天我和男朋友一起出去——我们去了长江中间的一个小岛。我现在正从岛上的一家户外运动主题咖啡馆给你写信，周围是露营椅和自行车。除了银河的照片，我还会附上一张今天拍的照片——只是手机随便拍的，但或许能让你窥见我的世界一角。\n\n是的，如果我们有一天结婚，你绝对会被邀请！😄 我想我可能会是那个求婚的人——去国外合法注册结婚也是计划的一部分。你认为这很浪漫，这让我很开心；说实话，我从来都不是一个童话故事迷，但这个……我希望它能成真。\n\n我很高兴你喜欢咖啡馆的想法。我一直在想——如果开实体店风险太大，或许我们可以尝试把一辆车改装成移动咖啡车。在毛绒玩具展或当地市场出现。谁知道呢？有时候奇怪的想法反而是最好的。\n\n至于你想要离开马里——我理解这是一个巨大的梦想。但也许，如果你有一天有机会，你可以从一次短途旅行开始？旅行可以是一种温和地尝试不同生活方式的方式。我大学时第一次去香港，给我留下了深刻的印象——文化的融合、基础设施、生活节奏。随着时间的推移，它确实不再那么神奇，但第一次的经历帮助我看到了有那么多不同的生活方式。也许在某个地方，有一种更适合你的生活方式——发现它可能是一个值得追求的目标。\n\n另外，请不要担心在关系中会让人失望——至少对我来说，完全不会。我真的很享受和你写信，你的信从不让我感到负担。恰恰相反，它们像一阵清新的空气。我认为我们都应该拥有能减轻压力的友谊，而不是增加更多的压力，对吧？\n\n我已经发给你银河的照片了！（不过……坦白说：并不是所有照片都是真正的银河照片 😅）。有些是在冬天，深夜，在中国东北的两个城市之间拍的。我不得不逃离城市光污染——这意味着要在寒冷、空旷的道路上开几个小时的车。但问题是：在北半球，冬天是看不到银河的。所以……我们就说加了一点后期处理的魔法 ✨。希望你不会介意。我觉得它们还是挺不错的。\n\n保重，一如既往，回复不急。我会在这里等你。\n\nÀ bientôt，\nDomino 🐾",

    "content": "Hello Dominoh,\n\nFirst off, no worries about the villa — you officially saved me from becoming ghost bait. I’ll take pasta over poltergeist any day. But I have to admit… now I’m the one haunted, just by curiosity instead of spirits.\n\nI really resonated with what you wrote about belonging. It’s funny — with a family history full of movement, I should feel like I belong everywhere, but in reality, I often feel like I belong nowhere. Maybe that’s why the Odyssey feels so natural to me: it’s less about finding “home” and more about constantly moving toward new pieces of it. I think you nailed it when you described that restless hunger. It’s not dissatisfaction with life — it’s wanting to stand in places you’ve never stood, breathe air that’s unfamiliar, and feel the weight of a place that doesn’t know your name yet.\n\nAnd about what you said regarding your dad, I understand that more than you know. Ironically, my dad did almost the same thing when I was young. He left for a new job when I was 7 and only came back when I was 14. By then, I couldn’t click with him the same way. I know it wasn’t his fault, but our personalities just don’t align. He’s extremely outgoing, extroverted, and seems to have the whole country as a friend or contact. hes very traditional and thinks that the ways of our ancestors are sacred and should not change. I’m the opposite — I prefer fewer friends but ones with real depth. He doesn’t like that I’m introverted and keeps trying to push me to be more like him, which is where we clash most. It’s basically my beliefs vs. his.\n\nAbout your confession — never watching a Ghibli movie all the way through — I actually respect that. Overhype can ruin discovery. And Ghibli deserves quiet discovery. You asked where to start… I won’t say Spirited Away or Howl’s because they’ve been meme'd to death. I’d start you with Kiki’s Delivery Service. It’s quieter, slower, and has no grand plot — just a small-town story about independence, burnout, and finding your rhythm in life. The magic is soft, not loud. Perfect for easing in without the hype noise.\n\nAlso, a side note: Kiki’s Delivery Service is actually what made me fall in love with coastal towns and cities. The atmosphere of that film — salty air, open skies, quiet streets — stuck with me. That’s one of the reasons I decided to start my university journey in Alexandria. It has that same mix of sea and city life. From there, I plan to transfer to France before beginning my Odyssey.\n\nYour pasta plan with your boyfriend made me laugh. I hope you mysteriously “stumble upon” it one Sunday soon. Pasta + Ghibli actually feels like a ritual worth guarding. Maybe one day, I’ll have to write you about my own Sunday setup in Alexandria after uni starts — probably with the Mediterranean in the background instead of Maadi’s quiet streets.\n\nBefore I wrap up, I’m curious: You mentioned you’ve never felt tied to any place. Do you think that makes you more likely to settle somewhere if you find the right spot, or do you see yourself moving constantly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you — pasta report included.\n\nyour friend\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "你好，多米诺，\n\n首先，关于别墅的事，你真的救了我，让我免于成为鬼魂的猎物。我宁愿选择意大利面而不是闹鬼。不过我得承认……现在我被好奇心困扰着，而不是被鬼魂。\n\n你写到归属感时，我真的很共鸣。说来好笑，我家的历史充满了迁徙，我本应觉得我属于每一个地方，但事实上，我常常觉得自己无处可归。也许这就是为什么《奥德赛》对我来说如此自然：它不仅仅是关于找到“家”，更多的是不断朝着新的部分前进。我觉得你描述的那种不安的渴望非常到位。这并不是对生活的不满，而是想要站在从未站过的地方，呼吸从未呼吸过的空气，感受一个还不知道你名字的地方的重量。\n\n关于你提到的你爸爸，我比你想象的更理解。讽刺的是，我爸爸在我小时候也几乎做了同样的事。他在我7岁时离开去了一份新工作，直到我14岁才回来。那时，我已经无法像以前那样与他相处了。我知道这并不是他的错，但我们的性格确实不合。他非常外向，喜欢交际，似乎整个国家都是他的朋友或联系人。他非常传统，认为祖先的方式是神圣不可改变的。而我恰恰相反，我更喜欢少而精的朋友，他不喜欢我内向的性格，总是试图让我变得更像他，这正是我们冲突最多的地方。这基本上就是我的信念与他的信念之间的矛盾。\n\n关于你的坦白——从未完整地看过一部吉卜力电影——我其实很尊重这一点。过度的期待会破坏发现的乐趣。而吉卜力电影值得静静地去发现。你问我从哪里开始看……我不会推荐《千与千寻》或《哈尔的移动城堡》，因为它们已经被过度恶搞了。我会建议你从《魔女宅急便》开始。这部电影更安静、更缓慢，没有宏大的剧情——只是一个小镇关于独立、倦怠和找到生活节奏的故事。魔法是柔和的，而不是喧嚣的。非常适合慢慢进入，而不被过度的期待所干扰。\n\n顺便说一句，《魔女宅急便》也是让我爱上沿海城镇和城市的原因。那部电影的氛围——咸咸的空气、开阔的天空、安静的街道——一直留在我的记忆中。这也是我决定在亚历山大开始我的大学生活的原因之一。从那里，我计划转学到法国，然后开始我的《奥德赛》之旅。\n\n你和你男朋友的意大利面计划让我笑了。希望你很快就能“偶然”在某个周日发现它。意大利面加吉卜力电影其实是一个值得守护的仪式。也许有一天，我会写信告诉你我在亚历山大的周日安排——背景是地中海，而不是马阿迪的安静街道。\n\n在结束之前，我很好奇：你提到你从未觉得被任何地方束缚。你觉得这会让你在找到合适的地方时更有可能定居，还是你认为自己会一直搬家？\n\n期待你的回信——包括意大利面的报告。\n\n你的朋友\n莫妮",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nYour family story honestly sounds like something out of a novel — full of movement, unexpected intersections, and invisible threads pulling people across borders. Growing up with all that around you must’ve been fascinating. It makes me think… being from such a background probably gives you a wider sense of the world from the very beginning.\n\nAnd funnily enough, I still relate to what you said about not feeling fully tied to any one place.\nMy childhood wasn’t particularly chaotic — actually, my family’s pretty close — but I’ve never really felt a strong sense of belonging. Not to my hometown, not to school, not even to the broader idea of “home.” Maybe it’s because my dad spent most of my early years working in a different city? I’m not great at psychological self-analysis, but I suspect that might be part of it.\n\nWhat I am sure of is that I’ve always had this restless hunger to see the world — to step into unfamiliar places, breathe in unfamiliar air, and collect little fragments of life from elsewhere.\nSo when I hear about your Odyssey, I get this electric mix of envy and excitement. You’re younger than me, but your drive and preparation are next-level. I genuinely hope the citizenship and French visa (and maybe someday, the passport too) come through smoothly. The world needs more travelers with purpose.\n\nNow, about that haunted villa —\nYou were really about to go just to send me pictures?? That’s both incredibly sweet and slightly unhinged 😭 Please don’t feel like you owe me photographic proof from a place full of hobos, ghosts, and God knows what else.\nHonestly, if your gut says “nope,” then nope it is. I’d rather hear your story safe and sound than get a blurry shot of some cursed wallpaper.\n\nThat said… I am curious now.\n\nAlso, your Ghibli Sundays sound like the kind of ritual I didn’t know I needed in my life. Pasta and animation — how could that go wrong? I showed the recipe to my boyfriend, and his eyes basically lit up. He’s the chef between us, so I’m hoping to mysteriously “stumble upon” that dish sometime soon.\n\nNow here’s a confession:\nI’ve never watched a Ghibli movie all the way through. Not one.\nThe truth is — and maybe you’ll understand — Ghibli films are so overhyped in China. People worship Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, Ponyo, The Wind Rises like they’re sacred texts. It’s not that I think they’re bad. It’s just… when something gets that adored, I tend to lose curiosity. Like the noise drowns out the magic.\n\nStill, I know they’re special. People whose taste I trust (like you) love them for real reasons. So maybe it’s time I make space for that quiet viewing someday. Just me, the screen, and no expectations.\n\nBesides Castle in the Sky, which one would you personally recommend I start with? Something less obvious, maybe? Help me ease into this Ghibli world properly.\n\nCan’t wait to hear from you again — pasta or poltergeist, your call. (But honestly… pasta XD)\n\nWarmly,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n你的家族故事听起来就像是一部小说——充满了迁徙、意外的交汇和无形的线，将人们拉过国界。在这样的环境中长大一定非常迷人。这让我觉得……这样的背景可能从一开始就给了你更广阔的世界观。\n\n有趣的是，我仍然能理解你说的不完全属于任何一个地方的感觉。\n我的童年并不特别混乱——实际上，我的家庭很亲密——但我从未真正感到强烈的归属感。无论是对我的家乡、学校，还是对“家”这个更广泛的概念。也许是因为我爸爸在我小时候的大部分时间都在另一个城市工作？我不擅长心理自我分析，但我觉得这可能是原因之一。\n\n我确定的是，我一直有一种不安分的渴望，想要去看看这个世界——走进陌生的地方，呼吸陌生的空气，收集来自别处的生活碎片。\n所以，当你提到你的奥德赛之旅时，我感到既羡慕又兴奋。你比我年轻，但你的决心和准备都是一流的。我真心希望你的公民身份和法国签证（也许有一天还有护照）能够顺利办理。这个世界需要更多有目标的旅行者。\n\n现在，关于那个闹鬼的别墅——\n你真的打算为了给我发照片就去那里吗？这既非常贴心又有点疯狂 😭 请不要觉得你欠我一张从满是流浪汉、鬼魂和天知道还有什么的地方拍来的照片。\n老实说，如果你的直觉说“不行”，那就不要去。我宁愿听到你平安无事的故事，也不想要一张模糊的诅咒壁纸。\n\n话说回来……我现在确实很好奇。\n\n另外，你的吉卜力周日听起来像是我生活中需要的一种仪式。意大利面和动画——这怎么可能出错？我把食谱给我的男朋友看了，他的眼睛都亮了。他是我们俩中的大厨，所以我希望他能“偶然”发现这道菜。\n\n现在有个坦白：\n我从未完整地看过一部吉卜力电影。一部都没有。\n事实是——也许你能理解——吉卜力电影在中国被捧得太高了。人们像崇拜圣典一样崇拜《千与千寻》、《哈尔的移动城堡》、《悬崖上的金鱼姬》、《起风了》。并不是我觉得它们不好。只是……当某样东西被捧得如此之高，我往往会失去好奇心。好像噪音淹没了魔力。\n\n不过，我知道它们是特别的。那些品味值得信赖的人（比如你）真的喜欢它们。所以也许是我该找个安静的时间，好好看看这些电影了。就我一个人，屏幕前，没有任何期待。\n\n除了《天空之城》，你个人推荐我从哪一部开始看？也许是一部不太显眼的？帮我好好进入这个吉卜力的世界吧。\n\n期待再次收到你的来信——无论是意大利面还是鬼魂，你来决定。不过说实话……意大利面 XD\n\n温暖地，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hello DominoH,\n\nI had to laugh at your “pyramids, sphinxes, camels” stereotype — no offense taken. Honestly, that’s what most people picture when they think of Egypt. I’m glad you researched Maadi, though, because you’re right: it’s not just postcard Egypt. It’s leafy streets, embassies tucked between old villas, the smell of fresh pastries mixing with Egyptian coffee, and a strange blend of languages on one block.\n\nThat being said, I’m originally from Sudan. I’ve only been living in Maadi for three years (almost four), so in a way, I’m still a foreigner here too. I might even be getting Egyptian citizenship soon, which is another step in this ongoing journey. I'm also thinking about studying in France, but after starting university here in Alexandria — a coastal governorate, just a couple of hours from Cairo — because transferring is easier than applying from the start. Hopefully, I’ll get the French passport eventually, making the odyssey more feasible.\n\nHere’s a fact about me that might explain why I don’t feel tied to just one country: my family history is full of crossings. My father’s father was from Luxor, Egypt, but he moved to Sudan, where he met my grandmother, who was from Turkey. I’ve always found it fascinating how two people from such different places ended up meeting in a third country and choosing to settle there.\nOn my mother’s side, the story is similar. Her maternal grandparents were from Mauritania, and her paternal grandparents were from India. So, as you can see, my family has been full of mixing. Maybe that’s why I’m drawn to so many places — I’ve never really been anchored to just one.\n\nAs for the urbex trips… plot twist: my little brother and cousin already visited the abandoned hospital without me. They said they couldnt wait till sunday but its the day im free from work they said they found lots of stray dogs were sleeping outside the hospital and they met some teenage boys from that area who advised them not to go inside or at least stay on the first floor because it was known to attract hobos, drug addicts, and maniacs. So yeah, they only checked out the first floor, but unfortunately, no photos or videos were taken. Now, there’s talk of exploring a famous haunted villa nearby. My little cousin claims he went in with friends once, and something inside chased them out — no words, just footsteps approaching. Honestly, I’m tempted to skip this one… but I promised you pictures, so I’ll stick to my word.\n\nYour thoughts on the Odyssey meant a lot. Planting these “connection seeds” feels like half the adventure before the journey even begins. I’m already hearing back from some really interesting people across different countries — it’s like my passport is collecting invisible stamps before I’ve even started the journey.\n\nSpeaking of passports, if you could pick a passport besides yours, what country would it be, and why\n\nBy the way, since you’re into short films and layered storytelling, I have to ask — do you like Studio Ghibli movies? They’re not exactly “short,” but their pacing, visuals, and subtle details always feel like lessons in cinema. I’m curious if you’ve ever drawn inspiration from them. I started a ritual on Sunday, where I pick a Studio Ghibli film and watch it, but beforehand, I cook a comfort meal (my favorite is chicken pasta with white sauce; here’s the recipe: https://talkingmeals.com/white-sauce-chicken-pasta-recipe/). Unlike traditional snacks, I gotta say Studio Ghibli movies aren’t like others — they’re more complex. They create strong character personalities, and they might not be linear or easy to understand most of the time, but they’re truly one-of-a-kind experiences. I still didn't finish a lot of them until now, but my favourite so far is their 2nd film, CASTLE IN THE SKY. God, I love that movie so so so so so much. Their movies make you feel like a kid again, not because they’re meant for kids, but because they’re so fascinating, like reminiscing about that Disney movie you watched with your mom when you were little. I highly recommend watching their films if you haven't already, but don’t watch the English dub — go for the original Japanese version with subtitles. I’m so mad at myself for missing out on these masterpieces all this time.\n\nLooking forward to your reply (and I’ll try not to send back too many haunted pictures next Sunday).\n\nWarmest regards,\nMoni",
    "translatedContent": "你好，DominoH，\n\n看到你提到的“金字塔、狮身人面像、骆驼”这些刻板印象，我忍不住笑了——当然，没有冒犯的意思。说实话，大多数人想到埃及时脑海里浮现的就是这些。不过我很高兴你研究了马阿迪，因为你说得对：这里不仅仅是明信片上的埃及。这里有绿树成荫的街道，老别墅间藏着大使馆，新鲜的糕点香味与埃及咖啡的香气交织在一起，一条街上就能听到多种语言的奇妙混合。\n\n不过，我得说，我其实是苏丹人。我搬到马阿迪才三年多一点，所以某种程度上，我在这里也还是个外国人。我甚至可能很快就会申请埃及国籍，这是我持续旅程中的又一步。我还考虑去法国留学，但打算先在亚历山大港的大学开始，因为从这里转学比直接申请要容易得多。希望最终我能拿到法国护照，这样我的旅程会更加顺利。\n\n这里有一个事实可能解释了为什么我不觉得只属于一个国家：我的家族历史充满了迁徙。我父亲的父亲来自埃及的卢克索，但他搬到了苏丹，在那里遇到了我的祖母，她来自土耳其。我一直觉得，两个来自不同地方的人在第三个国家相遇并选择定居在那里，这真是太神奇了。在我母亲这边，情况也类似。她的外祖父母来自毛里塔尼亚，而她的祖父来自印度。所以，正如你所见，我的家族一直是个大熔炉。也许这就是我为什么会被这么多地方吸引——我从未真正只属于一个地方。\n\n至于城市探险……有个小插曲：我的弟弟和表弟已经去参观了那家废弃的医院，没有我。他们说等不到周日了，而那天我正好有空。他们发现医院外面有很多流浪狗在睡觉，还遇到了一些当地的青少年，那些孩子建议他们不要进去，或者至少不要去二楼以上，因为那里常有流浪汉、吸毒者和疯子出没。所以他们只在一层看了看，但遗憾的是，没有拍下任何照片或视频。现在，他们又在谈论探索附近的一座著名鬼屋。我的小表弟说他和朋友们曾经进去过一次，里面有什么东西追着他们跑——没有声音，只有脚步声越来越近。说实话，我有点想跳过这次探险……但我答应过你拍照片，所以我会信守承诺。\n\n你对《奥德赛》的看法对我来说意义重大。种下这些“连接的种子”感觉就像是旅程开始前的一半冒险。我已经收到了来自不同国家的一些非常有趣的人的回复——就像我的护照在真正开始旅程前就已经收集了无形的印章。\n\n说到护照，如果可以选择一个除你自己的国家以外的护照，你会选择哪个国家，为什么？\n\n顺便说一句，既然你喜欢短片和多层次的叙事，我必须问——你喜欢宫崎骏的电影吗？虽然它们不算是“短片”，但它们的节奏、视觉效果和细腻的细节总是给人以电影的启示。我很好奇你是否从中获得过灵感。我从周日开始了一个仪式，每周挑选一部宫崎骏的电影观看，但在观看之前，我会做一顿安慰餐（我最喜欢的是白酱鸡肉意面；这是食谱：https://talkingmeals.com/white-sauce-chicken-pasta-recipe/）。与传统的小吃不同，我觉得宫崎骏的电影并不像其他电影那样简单——它们塑造了鲜明的角色性格，虽然不一定是线性的或容易理解，但确实是一次独一无二的体验。虽然我还有很多电影没有看完，但到目前为止，我最喜欢的是他们的第二部作品，《天空之城》。天哪，我太爱这部电影了。它们让你感觉像是回到了童年，不是因为它们是为孩子制作的，而是因为它们如此引人入胜，就像回忆起小时候和妈妈一起看的那部迪士尼电影。如果你还没有看过，我强烈推荐你观看这些电影，但不要看英文配音版——选择原版日语加字幕。我真后悔错过了这些杰作这么长时间。\n\n期待你的回复（我会尽量不在周日寄回太多鬼屋的照片）。\n\n最诚挚的问候，\nMoni",

    "content": "Dear Moni,\n\nFirst off — I have to admit something that might sound terribly cliché.\n\nWhen you mentioned you’re from Egypt, my brain instantly summoned a montage of pyramids, sphinxes, and camels. No offense — I just hadn’t thought much beyond the postcards. But after reading your letter, I looked up some photos of Maadi… and wow. It actually looks like a very lived-in place. Trees, villas, street food, kids in alleys — it’s nothing like the dusty tourist Egypt I had in my head. So thank you for adding a new dot to my mental world map.\n\nAlso — your upcoming urbex trip with your brother and cousin? I’m totally intrigued. Abandoned hospital? Count me in (vicariously). I’ve always had a soft spot for decaying buildings that still carry the fingerprints of history. Peeling paint, rusted doors, maybe a leftover wheelchair in a sunlit corridor… there’s a strange kind of dignity in those spaces. They age in style.\nDefinitely send photos — I’ll be waiting!\n\nI also checked out a bit more about Maadi (your letter got me curious), and it seems like a pretty important spot in Egypt? I read that there are embassies there, and lots of foreigners living in the area. It sounds like a surprisingly peaceful, even affluent place — I’m a little jealous, honestly. My city has its own charm, but we don’t really have streets where you hear five languages in an afternoon. That sounds like magic.\n\nAnd finally — your Odyssey.\nMan. The way you’re planting these “connection seeds” all around the globe before setting off… it’s genius, and honestly kind of electrifying. I can feel the drive in your words. I hope you get to step foot in every country your heart is drawn to — and I’ll be cheering you on from wherever I am.\nAs for me — if I ever manage to save enough, I think I’d hop on a plane with zero hesitation. No grand mission, just the dream of collecting stamps on my passport like they’re little time capsules.\n\nTalk soon — and fingers crossed the hospital isn’t haunted. (Or if it is… tell the ghost I said hi.)\n\nWarmly,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的莫妮，\n\n首先——我得承认一件事，这听起来可能有点老套。\n\n当你提到你来自埃及时，我的脑海里立刻浮现出金字塔、狮身人面像和骆驼的画面。没有冒犯的意思——我只是没有想得更远，超出了明信片的范畴。但读了你的信后，我查了一些马阿迪的照片……哇。那其实是一个充满生活气息的地方。树木、别墅、街头小吃、巷子里的孩子们——和我想象中的尘土飞扬的旅游胜地完全不同。所以谢谢你为我的世界地图增添了一个新的点。\n\n还有——你和你哥哥、堂弟即将进行的城市探险之旅？我非常好奇。废弃的医院？算我一个（虽然只能是虚拟的）。我一直对那些依然保留着历史痕迹的破败建筑情有独钟。剥落的油漆、生锈的门，也许还有阳光照耀下的走廊里留下的轮椅……这些地方有一种奇怪的尊严。它们老得很有风度。\n一定要发照片——我会等着看的！\n\n我还查了一些关于马阿迪的资料（你的信让我很好奇），那里似乎是埃及的一个相当重要的地方？我读到那里有很多大使馆，还有许多外国人居住。听起来那是一个非常宁静甚至富裕的地方——说实话，我有点嫉妒。我的城市也有它自己的魅力，但我们没有那种一个下午就能听到五种语言的街道。那听起来像魔法一样。\n\n最后——你的《奥德赛》。\n天哪。你在全球各地播下这些“连接种子”的方式真是太聪明了，而且老实说，这让我感到非常振奋。我能从你的字里行间感受到你的热情。我希望你能踏上你心中向往的每一个国家——我会从我所在的地方为你加油。\n至于我——如果我有朝一日能存够钱，我想我会毫不犹豫地登上飞机。没有宏大的使命，只是梦想着收集护照上的印章，就像收集小小的时间胶囊一样。\n\n很快再聊——希望那家医院没有闹鬼。（如果真的有，告诉鬼魂我问好。）\n\n温暖地，\n多米诺",

    "content": "Hello Domino,\n\nYour canyon shot stuck with me — I can see it like a frame from a film. Wide lens, horizon swallowing everything, and there you are… small in scale but anchored in the moment. I think you just described not only your worldview but also why your work has that layered pull.\n\nI like how your life goal mirrors mine in a way. You want to capture the earth’s raw beauty; I want to see it through human connection. Same planet, two lenses. And that line about “not everyone, just the earth in its purest form” — that’s poetry, even if you didn’t mean it to be.\n\nYour urbex approach actually makes a lot of sense. I think people imagine explorers as reckless, but in reality, calculated exploration takes just as much courage, maybe more. You’re scouting with precision, almost like a director planning a scene before shooting. Speaking of urbex, I have something funny — next Sunday, my little brother and my cousin want to explore an abandoned hospital 30 minutes away from our area. I’m not really into exploring abandoned places myself, but I’m going along just to keep an eye on them (and make sure they don’t get into trouble). I’ll send you pictures from it. Who knows, maybe I’ll gain a new appreciation for this whole urbex thing.\n\nSince you like landscapes, I’ll give you a little snapshot of where I live. I’m in Maadi — one of Cairo’s greener, quieter neighborhoods. It’s full of tall trees, old villas, and small streets that feel worlds away from the chaos of downtown Cairo. It's full of foreigners from all over the globe. Walk down the road and you’ll hear 5 languages being spoken in the span of an afternoon— it’s really fascinating. But beneath that, it’s still distinctly Egyptian, with small cafés, street food stalls, and kids playing football in alleys.\n\nAs for my Odyssey — I’m laying the groundwork now while I’m still in Egypt. My idea is to have letters and friendships scattered like pins across the globe before I set off. That way, when I finally reach each country, I’m not arriving cold. There’s already a person, a story, waiting for me there. It turns the trip into something much more alive.\n\nAnd I have to say — you calling me “Moni” already feels like you’ve fast-forwarded the friendship a bit. I’ll take it. 😉\n\nLooking forward to your next letter — and maybe hearing what landscapes are at the very top of your list.\n\nMoni",

And don’t worry about using Google Translate—your English is clear enough that your message shines through. De toute façon, tu peux toujours écrire en français, j’aime aussi pratiquer !\n\nI laughed when you asked me what I’d do if I won the lottery. Honestly, right now, the first thing I’d probably do is drag my boyfriend to the UK and get married. Two reasons for that: first, same-sex marriage is legally recognized there, and second, my boyfriend studied in the UK during university, so revisiting his memories together would be really special. Sure, we might not have a grand wedding, but I’ve always dreamed of a perfect honeymoon road trip. Maybe someday!\n\nAbout my furry fandom character—my fursona is actually a grumpy black cat. Not exactly the cuddly type, more like a tiny villain with a smug expression. 🐈‍⬛ But honestly, compared to some of my friends, I’m not that deeply into the furry fandom. They are much more devoted. I once even thought about opening a furry-themed café, where my boyfriend (who is a barista) would wear a half-fursuit and act as a cheerful puppy café manager. But at the moment, this plan is indefinitely on hold. My initial business model was kind of terrible—I’m pretty sure I’d go bankrupt within months if I opened it now. 😅\n\nOn a more serious note, I’m truly sorry to hear about the tension between who you are and your family’s beliefs. Je comprends parfaitement que ce soit épuisant et difficile. I know it must feel incredibly isolating and frustrating to hide such an important part of your identity. In China as well, most gay people end up staying in the closet due to similar societal pressures and family expectations. So, here’s a virtual hug from me to you. 🤗 Maybe, when you’re a little older and financially independent, you could consider moving out and creating your own space. Perhaps living on your own could give you the freedom and peace of mind you deserve.\n\nI fully relate to what you said about small circles and niche communities. That’s actually one of the reasons I find Slowly appealing. It provides a comfortable, high-quality interaction environment—something the mainstream internet lost a long time ago. In my experience, China is huge and quite varied. In small towns and rural areas, people tend to have much closer relationships—family, neighbors, friends, all helping each other out genuinely. But in bigger cities, things change drastically. Everyone seems busy with survival, work, or business connections. Friendships often get squeezed out by necessity, replaced by superficial interactions and obligations. Ça peut sembler un peu triste, mais c’est la réalité que je vis actuellement. But don’t get me wrong—I still have some real, true friends. Some live with me here in the city, and others are scattered across the country; we mostly keep in touch online, and only occasionally meet up. Those friendships are precious.\n\nAbout my urbex trips—I’m definitely on the introverted side, so photographing people isn’t really my thing. Maybe loneliness suits me better. I’ve photographed the Milky Way (which is challenging in China because of the extreme light pollution—I have to drive hours into remote places), abandoned factories, unfinished buildings, things like that. Maybe someday I can send you some of those photos!\n\nAs for my social anxiety, it’s a bit complicated. I think I have a sort of performative personality, in that I feel most comfortable socially when I’m somehow “in charge”—like if I’m organizing a trip, hosting a dinner, or even just ordering from a waiter (because I’m the one paying). Maybe I’m not afraid of social interaction itself, but rather of inconveniencing others? Je ne suis pas totalement sûr. C’est compliqué. 😅\n\nAnyway, thanks again for sharing your feelings with me. Your honesty is really precious, and I truly value the trust between us. Take your time replying, there’s no rush. Je serai toujours là.\n\nÀ bientôt, prends soin de toi,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "嘿，Lamine，\n\n非常感谢你的来信！😊 每次收到你的消息都让我感到很开心。别担心使用谷歌翻译——你的英语已经足够清晰，能够传达出你的意思。不管怎样，你也可以用法语写，我也喜欢练习！\n\n当你问我如果中了彩票会做什么时，我笑了。说实话，现在我最想做的第一件事就是带着我的男朋友去英国结婚。有两个原因：首先，同性婚姻在英国是合法的；其次，我的男朋友在大学期间曾在英国学习，所以一起重访他的回忆会非常特别。当然，我们可能不会有盛大的婚礼，但我一直梦想着一次完美的蜜月自驾游。也许有一天吧！\n\n关于我的毛绒粉丝角色——我的毛人其实是一只脾气暴躁的黑猫。不是那种特别亲人的类型，更像是一个小恶棍，总是带着得意的表情。🐈‍⬛ 但说实话，和我的一些朋友相比，我对毛绒粉丝圈的投入并不算深。他们要投入得多。我曾经想过开一家毛绒主题的咖啡馆，让我的男朋友（他是一名咖啡师）穿上半身毛装，扮演一个开朗的狗狗咖啡馆经理。但目前这个计划无限期搁置了。我的初步商业模式有点糟糕——如果现在开业，我肯定几个月内就会破产。😅\n\n更严肃地说，听到你和家人之间的观念冲突，我感到非常遗憾。我完全理解这会让人感到疲惫和艰难。我知道，隐藏如此重要的一部分身份，一定感到非常孤独和沮丧。在中国，大多数同性恋者也因为类似的社会压力和家庭期望而选择隐藏自己的身份。所以，这里给你一个虚拟的拥抱。🤗 也许，当你长大一些，经济独立后，可以考虑搬出去，创造自己的空间。也许独自生活能给你应得的自由和心灵的平静。\n\n我完全理解你所说的关于小圈子和小众社区。这其实是我喜欢慢慢（Slowly）的原因之一。它提供了一个舒适、高质量的互动环境——这是主流互联网很久以前就失去的东西。以我的经验，中国很大，也很多样化。在小城镇和农村地区，人们的关系往往更紧密——家人、邻居、朋友，都真诚地互相帮助。但在大城市里，情况就完全不同了。每个人似乎都在忙于生存、工作或商业联系。友谊往往被必需品挤占，被表面的互动和义务所取代。这听起来有点悲伤，但这就是我目前的生活现实。但别误会——我仍然有一些真正的朋友。有些人和我住在这个城市，有些人则分散在全国各地；我们主要通过网络保持联系，偶尔见面。这些友谊非常珍贵。\n\n关于我的城市探险之旅——我确实比较内向，所以拍摄人像并不是我的强项。也许孤独更适合我。我拍摄过银河（在中国这很有挑战性，因为光污染非常严重，我不得不驱车数小时到偏远的地方），废弃的工厂，未完成的建筑，等等。也许有一天我可以给你发一些这些照片！\n\n至于我的社交焦虑，情况有点复杂。我觉得我有一种表演型人格，即在某种“掌控”状态下，我最能自如地社交——比如组织旅行、举办晚宴，甚至只是点餐（因为我付钱）。也许我不是害怕社交本身，而是害怕给别人带来不便？我不完全确定。这很复杂。😅\n\n无论如何，再次感谢你和我分享你的感受。你的坦诚非常珍贵，我真的很珍惜我们之间的信任。不用急着回复，慢慢来。我永远都在这里。\n\n期待你的回信，保重，\nDomino",

    "content": "Dear Momin,\n\nIt’s a pleasure to hear from you — your Odyssey sounds absolutely wild. I don’t think I’ve ever dared to daydream about visiting all 197 countries, even in my most delusional moments. That’s next-level ambition.\nBut I do love traveling. One of my personal life goals is to earn enough money to see all the breathtaking natural landscapes this planet has to offer. Not everything, not everyone — just the earth in its purest form.\n\nAlso, thank you — really — for reading through my profile so attentively. Or was it my letter? Either way, I appreciate the thoughtful curiosity.\nAbout the short films: recently, I’ve been leaning toward telling compact stories using relatively polished cinematography. You probably noticed my little involvement in the furry fandom — sometimes I let furry characters take the lead role in my videos. It’s fun, a bit theatrical, and allows for some layered storytelling without showing my actors' actual face.\n\nWhen it comes to urbex, I’m honestly not the wild, spontaneous type who’ll just hop fences or crawl through drain pipes at 3 a.m. My anxiety wouldn’t survive that. I’m very result-driven, and the idea of wandering without a destination makes me uncomfortable. So most of my urbex trips are to places already scouted by others — shut-down factories, half-finished buildings, wartime bunkers lost to history, or overgrown railroads.\nBut then again, if I’m driving and happen to spot an abandoned place by chance… I might just swerve the wheel and detour on impulse. I guess a small part of me wants to be spontaneous.\n\nI used to be more physically active as a kid, but honestly now? I’m kind of a couch creature. Not a fan of most sports, which means I’ve gained a bit of weight these years. Maybe I do need to take a page from your book and find a sport that at least gets my body moving again.\n\nIf I had to describe my worldview in a single camera shot… I think it would go like this:\nThe scene is on the edge of a canyon — maybe the Grand Canyon, or something similarly vast and awe-striking (I always forget the names). My car is parked slightly off-angle at the cliff’s edge. I’m leaning on the hood with a camera in hand. The lens is ultra wide. The shot captures the immensity of the ridges and rock folds in front of me… and in contrast, just how small I am. Me and the Earth — in the same frame.\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about how you’re planning your Odyssey.\nAnd if I get a second letter from you… I’m totally calling you Moni next time 😉\n\nWarm regards,\nDomino",
    "translatedContent": "亲爱的Momin，\n\n收到你的来信真是一大乐事——你的奥德赛之旅听起来简直太疯狂了。我想我从未敢在最不切实际的梦中幻想过访问全部197个国家。那真是顶级的雄心壮志。\n但我确实热爱旅行。我的一个个人生活目标就是赚足够的钱，去欣赏这个星球上所有令人叹为观止的自然景观。不是所有的一切，也不是所有人——只是地球最纯粹的样子。\n\n另外，真的非常感谢你如此仔细地阅读了我的个人资料。或者说是我的信？无论如何，我都非常感激你这种深思熟虑的好奇心。\n关于短片：最近，我倾向于用相对精致的摄影技术讲述紧凑的故事。你可能注意到了我在毛绒兽迷群体中的小小参与——有时我会让毛绒兽角色在我的视频中担任主角。这很有趣，有点戏剧性，而且可以在不展示演员真实面孔的情况下进行多层次的叙事。\n\n说到城市探险，我坦白说并不是那种会随意翻越围栏或凌晨3点爬排水管的狂野自发型。我的焦虑承受不了那种刺激。我非常注重结果，漫无目的地游荡让我感到不安。所以我的大多数城市探险都是去别人已经探查过的地方——废弃的工厂、未完工的建筑、被遗忘的战时掩体或荒废的铁路。\n但话说回来，如果我在开车时偶然发现一个废弃的地方……我可能会突然转向，冲动地绕道。我想，我的内心深处还是有一点渴望自发性的。\n\n小时候我更活跃一些，但老实说现在呢？我有点变成了一个沙发生物。对大多数运动都不感兴趣，这意味着这几年我确实长了一些体重。也许我真的需要从你的书中汲取一些灵感，找到一项至少能让我的身体动起来的运动。\n\n如果要用一个镜头来描述我的世界观……我想应该是这样的：\n场景是在一个峡谷的边缘——可能是大峡谷，或者类似的巨大而令人敬畏的地方（我总是记不住名字）。我的车停在悬崖边缘，稍微倾斜。我靠在引擎盖上，手里拿着相机。镜头是超广角的。画面捕捉到我面前的山脊和岩石褶皱的宏大……相比之下，我显得多么渺小。我和地球——在同一画面中。\n\n期待听到更多关于你如何规划你的奥德赛之旅。\n如果我再收到你的第二封信……下次我就叫你Moni了😉\n\n温暖的问候，\nDomino",

There’s something about your mix of filmmaking, photography, TRPG storytelling, and urbex exploration that just feels cinematic in the best way—like you don’t just document stories, you live inside them.\n\nI'm momin, 19 years old from Sudan, currently based in Egypt,\nI’m preparing for something I call The Odyssey—a personal goal to visit every single country on Earth. Not just to travel, but to understand the world, piece by piece. I’m still in the early stages, but before I set off, I’m trying to connect with people who see the world through creative, curious lenses. Your profile hit that nerve instantly.\n\nThe fact that you're a certified Pastafarian minister (still smiling at that), slightly shy, into furries, urbex, and stories that start with letters—there’s real humanity and imagination in all of that. I’d love to hear about the kinds of short films you make or how you choose which abandoned places to explore. Also, I’m about to start Taekwondo—curious if you’re into martial arts or anything physical that balances out your storytelling life.\n\nIf you had to describe your worldview in a single camera shot… what would it be?\n\nLooking forward to chatting.\nMomin (Moni, if we're keeping it casual)",

If you won the lottery and became a millionaire, what's the first thing you'd do?\n\nWhat's your Fandom Furry character? Unfortunately yes, I feel really bad not liking the same things as other people, not being like them. I feel like something's broken inside me.\n\nThe fact that I feel lonely even with my family, I think it comes from my sexual orientation (I could never show them this part of me) and beliefs, my family is Muslim, Mali is almost a Muslim country, and I don't consider myself Muslim but I can't tell them so I have to pretend to adhere to this religion.\nThese are everyday things that seem trivial but which prevent me from really being who I am. I've always been playing a role and it's very exhausting.\n\nIt may sound odd, but places where people stay in small circles are great haha. For many people, community life like in Mali is ideal, but I feel like I'm trapped in a Cage. Otherwise, I thought that in China people were closer to each other.\n\nOh that's a great activity, do you take pictures of these abandoned places? You too have trouble with superficial conversations, I'm relieved to see I'm not the only one.\nHow else do you manage to live your introversion to the full while maintaining a decent social life?\n\nGlad to know that writing to me helps you with your French🤗....

Il y a tellement de choses que j’aimerais faire... but sadly, most of them cost money. That’s the thing, right? Growing up means juggling dreams and survival. 😅\n\nAbout the furry fandom—you actually understood it pretty well! Oui, c’est une sorte de cosplay, mais centré sur les personnages animaux. It’s a very niche subculture, so not knowing it is totally normal. I just hope you don’t feel bad or “different” for not liking what everyone else does—ça va. Your openness and curiosity already mean a lot more.\n\nYou mentioned loneliness even around your family. That really moved me. I’d love to ask: pourquoi tu sens que tu ne peux pas être toi-même devant ta famille? If it’s not too difficult to talk about, I’d really like to understand more.\n\nThe way you described Mali makes me think of strong liens humains—a real sense of community. Where I live, à Nanjing (Nankin), in China, things are very different. People are more distant. You rarely know your neighbors. Most people stick to petits cercles—friends, colleagues—but beyond that, we’re strangers.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m quite introverted too—je suis une personne très introvertie. That’s part of why I love urbex. I like driving far away, exploring des endroits abandonnés, getting lost in quiet spaces. It helps me recharge. I don’t dislike people—but I’m only really comfortable with deep, meaningful conversations. So, maybe we’re both a bit “misplaced” in overly social settings, haha.\n\nOh, and by the way—I studied French in university, but je ne suis pas très bon 😅。I mostly use English now, but I’m hoping to get better with time. Writing with you helps already!\n\nÀ bientôt j’espère. Prends soin de toi 🌿\nDomino",

Would you like your life to be more exciting?\n\nIsn't furry fandom a kind of Cosplay but in general animal characters? ( Sorry I'm not very well informed.). Sometimes I wonder what's wrong with me, why I'm not interested in the same things as everyone else.\n\nOh, you think it's brave of me to face loneliness? Thank you, that's comforting. You know the saddest thing is that I'm surrounded by my loving family and they're the people I love most in the world, but that doesn't stop me feeling very alone. I feel that the fact that I can't be 100% myself with people creates distance between them and me.\n\nDaily life here in Mali depends on what kind of person you are. If you're a social person, then you'll love life here, because here life is communal, everyone knows each other in the neighbourhood, people form little groups in front of their houses, to chat, have a good time together etc...\nBut if you're an introvert like me it's just hell haha, if you don't get out of the house too much and you're not the type to talk to everyone in the neighborhood, people take it badly, you're seen as something haughty. A lot of people idealize community life, and I find it horrible sometimes because it's intolerant of difference.\n\nHere we eat a lot of rice with different sauces, and weekends are like everywhere else I suppose, people go out with their friends, relax or work...\n\nAnd how is life in your country?\n\nÀ bientôt,\nLamine 🥀",

I work mainly with visuals: photography, short videos, and sometimes just collecting fragments of stories that may someday become something more. I’d say my life isn’t very exciting, but it has its quiet moments of joy.\n\nI’m a light participant in the furry fandom — not the most social person around (I’m probably textbook ISTJ), so I often feel quite boring in conversations.

That’s actually how I met my boyfriend, so I guess life sometimes has ways of connecting us in the most unexpected ways.\n\nYour letter carries a quiet kind of vulnerability — I can’t say I’ve experienced the same things, but I understand what it feels like when the world moves too fast, or when being alone starts to feel more familiar than comforting. Still, I admire your decision to lean into it instead of running away. There’s something very brave in that.\n\nI’ve never been to Mali and honestly know very little about it, so now I’m quite curious. What’s everyday life like there? What do people eat?
